19:03:56 <Jeremy_Rand> #meetingtopic Namecoin Development Meeting
19:05:01 <Jeremy_Rand> Hello everyone, welcome to the meeting
19:05:21 <Jeremy_Rand> Can we get a roll call of who's here today?
19:06:04 <jbisch> hi
19:06:13 <Jeremy_Rand> Hi jbisch
19:07:58 <Jeremy_Rand> #topic Namecoin Core
19:09:17 <jonasbits> hi
19:09:30 <Jeremy_Rand> hello jonasbits
19:10:16 <Jeremy_Rand> So on the Namecoin Core front, I think not a lot has happened since last meeting, unless I'm unaware of something
19:10:42 <Jeremy_Rand> #info samurai321 on Reddit brought up possible compatibility issues between the name tab PR and 0.3.x wallet.dat files.
19:11:09 <Jeremy_Rand> #link https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/67#issuecomment-247847543
19:11:58 <Jeremy_Rand> #help We still need someone to test for the issue that samurai321 brought up
19:12:55 <Jeremy_Rand> Anyone interested in checking an 0.3.80-created wallet with brand0's name tab PR?
19:14:07 <brand0> Whoops, I'm here now.
19:14:17 <Jeremy_Rand> hey brand0
19:15:23 <Jeremy_Rand> I'm not likely to be able to do that 0.3.80 wallet test in the next couple weeks, unless my schedule ends up lighter than expected
19:16:05 <brand0> 0.3.80 won't run or compile on any of my systems -- the dependencies are too old
19:17:09 <Jeremy_Rand> brand0: I'd expect it to run okay on Debian Jessie, if that's available to you
19:17:10 <Jeremy_Rand> (I'm pretty sure I've built+run it on Jessie before)
19:17:32 <brand0> I'm all arch
19:17:36 <brand0> I'll set up a VM
19:17:47 <brand0> but I feel like independent verification has more weight here
19:17:47 <Jeremy_Rand> I think I had to install BDB from either Wheezy or Squeeze though
19:17:55 <Jeremy_Rand> yeah, agreed
19:18:01 <brand0> this is the last thing to test right?
19:18:08 <brand0> (that we know of)
19:18:31 <Jeremy_Rand> at the moment my priority with the name tab is verifying that the wallet unlocking code works properly with my wallet that has a bunch of dead queued transactions in it
19:18:51 <Jeremy_Rand> I expect to be able to test that this week
19:18:56 <brand0> alright. i've confirmed that. but verification would be nice.
19:19:33 <Jeremy_Rand> I can't think of any other blocker bugs off the top of my head, but there might be some on GitHub that I'm forgetting
19:20:38 <brand0> samurai321 mentioned something about the windows installer crashing
19:20:55 <brand0> when he clicked "run after installing" or something, dunno if that could be related
19:21:10 <Jeremy_Rand> was it the installer?  I thought his client crashed the first time he shut it down?
19:21:30 <Jeremy_Rand> The installer shouldn't be crashing, that's not Bitcoin code, it's entirely generated by NSIS
19:22:24 <Jeremy_Rand> on that note, my Windows VM's are currently undergoing a reinstall from scratch, so I can't easily test things on Windows for at least a couple days
19:23:12 <brand0> oh yeah maybe it was namecoin-core shutdown
19:23:17 <brand0> i read that wrong
19:23:26 <brand0> just said "it crashed" though
19:23:45 <Jeremy_Rand> maybe ask him for clarification?
19:24:24 <jonasbits> https://github.com/markhuber/modern-ie-vagrant if you need a quick vm to test in
19:25:08 <Jeremy_Rand> jonasbits: I can probably get the VM's installed pretty quick, there are just a lot of quirks with Windows VM's
19:25:41 <Jeremy_Rand> e.g. Windows Update sits there spinning for *days* eating a core, saying it's checking for updates
19:25:51 <Jeremy_Rand> unless you install a specific fix from the Microsoft website
19:26:23 <Jeremy_Rand> it's 2016 and Microsoft still can't implement the equivalent of apt-get
19:27:13 <Jeremy_Rand> anyway,
19:27:18 <brand0> lol
19:27:28 <brand0> okay I asked for clarification and possibly more information
19:27:35 <jonasbits> i used the above vm yesterday, but this repo is one step better i think
19:28:03 <Jeremy_Rand> #action Jeremy_Rand will try to test the wallet unlocking fixes in the name tab PR
19:28:14 <Jeremy_Rand> relatedly
19:29:05 <Jeremy_Rand> #idea Could we do Gitian builds of PR's in the future by using tags in the namecoin/namecoin-core repo?  E.g. nc0.13.99-name-tab-beta1
19:29:22 <Jeremy_Rand> That way the Gitian workflow (e.g. gsign/gverify) is a lot simpler
19:30:05 <Jeremy_Rand> I think Daniel approved this a while back but we never actually got it set up
19:30:21 <Jeremy_Rand> (something to do with me not ever actually making the tags)
19:31:43 <Jeremy_Rand> I think Bitcoin just uses Luke-Jr's Bitcoin Knots for that purpose, which is a lot of extra bother that I'd rather not do
19:34:59 <Jeremy_Rand> any thoughts on that?
19:35:27 <brand0> it sounds cool. i don't know how any of this stuff is working though.
19:35:53 <jbisch> I don't think we should also maintain a Bitcoin Knots fork.
19:36:38 <Jeremy_Rand> brand0: the gsign/gverify scripts in Gitian will automatically sync the Gitian sigs with our sigs repo on GitHub
19:37:00 <Jeremy_Rand> so no need to post the sigs on Reddit or in an issue tracker
19:37:45 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: yeah, I think just adding some extra tags to our main repo with PR's merged is way easier than what Luke does with Knots
19:38:54 <jbisch> Why merge it in first instead of going off of the PR author's fork? For posterity?
19:39:52 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: reproducible builds should be immutable, and it also reduces the tinkering needed for use with the release process docs
19:40:58 <Jeremy_Rand> I'd rather not rely on every PR author that we get keeping their branches/tags online forever
19:41:15 <jbisch> okay
19:41:41 <Jeremy_Rand> also there are those of us who just copy+paste from the release-process.md doc without thinking about what we're pasting :)
19:43:13 <Jeremy_Rand> ok, so sounds like we're all okay with using tags on the namecoin/namecoin-core repo for future Gitian PR builds?
19:43:30 <Jeremy_Rand> (at least as a trial)
19:43:57 <jbisch> yeah
19:44:01 <jonasbits> agreed
19:44:05 <brand0> yup
19:44:56 <Jeremy_Rand> #agreed Future Gitian PR builds will be done via tags on namecoin/namecoin-core repo; we will re-evaluate as needed
19:45:17 <Jeremy_Rand> any other Namecoin Core related things anyone would like to bring up?
19:45:47 <jbisch> Does static analysis belong here?
19:46:24 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: how about we do static analysis right after any other Namecoin Core related things?
19:46:27 <jonasbits> i can confirm that arm7 builds does work on my rpi3 noobs install
19:46:58 <Jeremy_Rand> jonasbits: fyi that's exactly the kind of message that can be prefixed with #info
19:47:04 <Jeremy_Rand> meetbot is cool
19:47:33 <Jeremy_Rand> and that's excellent, good to hear that the ARM builds are working
19:48:12 <jonasbits> i plan to run a testnet node 24/7 on that
19:48:18 <Jeremy_Rand> cool
19:49:01 <Jeremy_Rand> #info jonasbits confirms that arm7 builds work on rpi3
19:49:45 <Jeremy_Rand> anything else on Namecoin Core, or should we switch topics to static analysis?
19:49:48 <jonasbits> they are automatically built on gitian now
19:50:26 <Jeremy_Rand> jonasbits: yeah, I saw that Bitcoin Core added that.  I was a bit sad that my Gitian builds take twice as long though
19:52:31 <Jeremy_Rand> #topic Static analysis
19:53:20 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: you wanted to bring some stuff up here?
19:54:24 <jbisch> I just ran scan-build on Namecoin Core and got a couple of scan results and a lot of analyzer failures, but I think I did it wrong.
19:55:17 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: you might find the csbuild and csdiff tools that are packaged in Fedora interesting
19:55:38 <Jeremy_Rand> sadly they're not in Debian right now
19:55:43 <Jeremy_Rand> not even unstable
19:55:55 <Jeremy_Rand> they're probably easy to build for Debian though
19:56:46 <jbisch> I'll look at that. My problem seems to be that I didn't run scan-build on the configure script when you are supposed to do so in addition to the make command.
19:56:48 <Jeremy_Rand> basically they run GCC, Clang Analyzer, and cppcheck on a codebase as it's built, and they can do diff operations on the results for different runs
19:57:12 <Jeremy_Rand> in our case, we'd want to do 2 diff operations
19:57:27 <Jeremy_Rand> a diff against Bitcoin Core upstream, and a diff against consecutive commits in Namecoin Core
19:58:29 <Jeremy_Rand> FYI in theory kld is planning to tinker with this, but I know he has limited time availability so he'd probably love to get some assistance
19:59:47 <Jeremy_Rand> Also my understanding is that kld is planning to use static analysis as a method of getting some experience with the Namecoin codebase, but plans to switch to doing Android related stuff once he's gotten the hang of things
20:00:47 <jbisch> Yeah, I just wanted to look into static analyzers and had Namecoin Core nearby. :)
20:01:25 <Jeremy_Rand> relatedly
20:01:49 <Jeremy_Rand> we decided a few days ago to stay away from Coverity due to license restrictions
20:02:19 <Jeremy_Rand> That said, it's come to my attention that Tor and Monero are using Coverity (unless I'm misreading things)
20:02:51 <Jeremy_Rand> so perhaps it would be useful if I ask either the Tor people or the Monero people about their experience with it
20:03:18 <Jeremy_Rand> I still favor using free software tools though
20:03:28 <jbisch> They may just not have read the license.
20:03:53 <Jeremy_Rand> I assume the Tor people have enough lawyers around that they've read it?
20:04:00 <Jeremy_Rand> Less sure about Monero
20:04:39 <Jeremy_Rand> anyway, I figure it can't hurt to ask
20:05:28 <Jeremy_Rand> (other than sinking my available time for more useful things)
20:06:05 <Jeremy_Rand> so I'll probably put it on the "next time I happen to be chatting with fluffypony I'll bring it up; same goes for the Tor people" list
20:08:20 <Jeremy_Rand> in case anyone's wondering why kld isn't here today, it's presumably because his 2-3 hours per week of dev time would be 50% depleted by our meetings :)
20:08:51 <jbisch> Only 50%? :)
20:09:24 <Jeremy_Rand> But when he's got some cool stuff to report, I'll see if he can join our meetings for a few minutes
20:09:47 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: our meetings are roughly 2-3 hours every 2 weeks, so that would be 50%, unless my math is broken
20:11:11 <Jeremy_Rand> anyway, jbisch do you want to summarize your scan-build adventures with an #info command for the minutes?
20:13:10 <jbisch> #info I tried running scan-build for static analysis and realized you need to run it for both ./configure and make if the project uses autotools.
20:14:34 <Jeremy_Rand> cool
20:14:49 <Jeremy_Rand> any other static analysis things to bring up?
20:16:04 <jbisch> No
20:16:12 <brand0> no
20:17:09 <Jeremy_Rand> #topic SPV
20:17:57 <Jeremy_Rand> #info I did some security review of libdohj-namecoin, and fixed a bug
20:18:07 <brand0> nice
20:18:47 <Jeremy_Rand> #info the bug impacted a non-default verification mode (the one that retrieves a single full block over P2P after getting the height over REST)
20:19:00 <Jeremy_Rand> #info fix has been submitted to upstream libdohj
20:19:17 <Jeremy_Rand> #info and that is why the code isn't being distributed to end users yet.  :)
20:20:48 <Jeremy_Rand> If anyone was unwise enough to be doing daily use of something that was advertised as a "conference-demo-quality beta",
20:21:25 <Jeremy_Rand> then I hope they're okay with getting false name results from malicious P2P nodes
20:21:55 <Jeremy_Rand> then again, people who do such things probably have already gotten pwned in multiple ways
20:22:36 <Jeremy_Rand> other than that, I'd be surprised if anyone was using that particular verification mode
20:23:03 <Jeremy_Rand> the restmerkleapi mode and the leveldbtxcache mode are much cooler
20:23:41 <jonasbits> indeed
20:24:18 <Jeremy_Rand> anyway, rnicoll hasn't yet merged the fix to upstream, so any deployment to end users is blocked by that being merged
20:24:34 <Jeremy_Rand> not like there aren't already lots of other things blocking deployment to end users
20:24:46 <Jeremy_Rand> like, say, getting all of the bitcoinj-addons code upstreamed
20:26:37 <Jeremy_Rand> any other SPV topics anyone would like to bring up?
20:29:32 <Jeremy_Rand> oh actually
20:30:07 <Jeremy_Rand> #help Can some people please test out the SPV codebase?  It's not that hard to build from source.
20:30:48 <Jeremy_Rand> The bounty has been in limbo for... probably more than a month, because no one else has tested it
20:32:15 <Jeremy_Rand> Also,
20:32:39 <Jeremy_Rand> #help Can anyone look into what privacy improvements the Bitsquare people made to their fork of BitcoinJ?
20:33:05 <Jeremy_Rand> #info I believe pigeons said they've done some useful work on it, but I haven't really had a chance to examine it
20:34:40 <Jeremy_Rand> Bitsquare seems to be aiming for anonymity modulo blockchain leakage, and they seem to have a good reputation, so I'd hope that maybe they've fixed some of the more egregious issues in BitcoinJ
20:35:36 <Jeremy_Rand> I'd be hesitant to adopt a fork of BitcoinJ though -- but I'd be curious if there's any work on getting that stuff upstreamed
20:39:06 <Jeremy_Rand> any other SPV things?
20:41:57 <brand0> nope
20:42:08 <Jeremy_Rand> ok, so moving on
20:42:23 <Jeremy_Rand> #topic Tor
20:43:02 <Jeremy_Rand> #info I've been engaging with Jesse Victors of OnioNS to see how we can collaborate
20:43:33 <brand0> oh cool
20:43:50 <Jeremy_Rand> In particular, initially we've been focusing on fleshing out the differences in threat model between Namecoin and OnioNS
20:45:22 <Jeremy_Rand> and also we've been discussing the integration with Tor (both in terms of data stored in naming system, and in terms of getting Tor to use an external naming system)
20:46:30 <Jeremy_Rand> Jesse has been very helpful
20:47:19 <Jeremy_Rand> Also I need to read his latest paper on OnioNS, since I haven't really studied up on his work in detail since I read his thesis
20:47:45 <Jeremy_Rand> which would have been... 2 years ago?  I've lost track
20:50:01 <Jeremy_Rand> any other Tor-related things anyone would like to bring up?
20:54:12 <Jeremy_Rand> ok, so next up
20:54:16 <Jeremy_Rand> #topic TLS
20:54:37 <Jeremy_Rand> #info hl, ryan-c, and I agreed on some changes to the TLS cert spec
20:54:51 <Jeremy_Rand> #link https://github.com/ifa-wg/proposals/pull/24#issuecomment-249307249
20:55:15 <Jeremy_Rand> #info I'm about halfway through implementing those changes in ncdns
20:58:20 <Jeremy_Rand> anything else TLS-related to bring up?
21:01:15 <Jeremy_Rand> anyone have additional development related topics, or should we move onto public relations?
21:03:16 <jonasbits> i think move on
21:03:31 <Jeremy_Rand> #topic Public relations
21:03:54 <Jeremy_Rand> So at the moment it looks like we have 4 OU students who are interested in working with us
21:04:00 <Jeremy_Rand> which is a nice increase from last year
21:04:32 <Jeremy_Rand> I think only 2 of them have introduced themselves on IRC yet
21:05:11 <Jeremy_Rand> #info it looks like we have 4 OU students who are interested in working with us
21:05:29 <Jeremy_Rand> meanwhile
21:06:03 <Jeremy_Rand> #info I *might* apply to give a talk at OU's Social Justice Symposium
21:06:13 <Jeremy_Rand> #link https://www.ou.edu/content/gec/equality-and-social-justice.html
21:06:29 <Jeremy_Rand> I'm still trying to figure out what the focus of the talk would be
21:06:39 <Jeremy_Rand> and they want submissions by Friday
21:07:29 <Jeremy_Rand> the talks can be either 25 mins + 5 minutes Q&A, or 50 mins + 10 mins Q&A (if I recall correctly from the website)
21:08:39 <Jeremy_Rand> I'd lean toward focusing on why privacy/security/free speech on the Internet affect other human rights issues, then talking about how Namecoin can help (in nontechnical terms)
21:09:08 <Jeremy_Rand> e.g. mention the CA system's trust issues, and the usability issues in .onion
21:09:37 <Jeremy_Rand> also possibly mention the political issues we've encountered, e.g. browser vendors refusing to implement API's that would make our lives easier
21:09:53 <Jeremy_Rand> (again, in nontechnical terms)
21:10:20 <Jeremy_Rand> I've presented on Namecoin to a roomful of social science majors before, so I can probably adapt some of the nontechnical descriptions in that talk
21:10:52 <Jeremy_Rand> any suggestions on this?
21:18:20 <Jeremy_Rand> guess not :(
21:18:40 <Jeremy_Rand> #info the website FAQ has been updated/expanded a bit
21:19:38 <Jeremy_Rand> any other public relations things?
21:20:56 <jonasbits> maybe easy tasks could bring more people to the project, like running nodes with arm devices
21:22:02 <Jeremy_Rand> Yeah, that might be interesting
21:22:23 <Jeremy_Rand> jonasbits: btw, that's an excellent use for the #idea command for meetbot :)
21:22:59 <jonasbits> must the #idea tag be in front?
21:23:06 <Jeremy_Rand> I believe so
21:23:25 <Jeremy_Rand> or at least, all the examples do so
21:24:08 <jonasbits> #idea Easy tasks for beginners, to bring more people to the project, on task could be: - Run namecoind on Arm7 device
21:24:18 <jonasbits> *one
21:25:23 <Jeremy_Rand> #idea I know that ATI used to give out tiny bug bounties (like $3 USD per bug) in order to encourage the community to test out betas
21:25:44 <Jeremy_Rand> If at some point we end up with some money to spare on such a scheme, might be interesting
21:26:06 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: how did that system work out in practice for ATI?
21:26:16 <Jeremy_Rand> did it actually result in better quality releases?
21:26:43 <Jeremy_Rand> As an outsider lurking in their forum, it looked effective to me
21:29:46 <jbisch> I'm not sure if they were effective or not.
21:30:01 <jbisch> I imagine they were.
21:30:33 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: do I recall correctly that Alan actually did them before ATI was a thing?
21:30:43 <Jeremy_Rand> (i.e. with limited funding available)
21:31:35 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: is there anyone from Armory whom you could ask whether it was effective in practice?  Maybe Goatpig or Doug?
21:32:39 <Jeremy_Rand> Like, if we could speed up our beta to final release cycle significantly, that might be a useful way to spend, say, $50 USD of our NMDF or Bountysource funds
21:33:14 <Jeremy_Rand> I don't think it's a great use of our developers' time to be beta testing each other's stuff all the time
21:33:45 <jbisch> Maybe Goatpig would know. I'm not sure if he was involved in administrating the bounty program or to what degree.
21:34:01 <Jeremy_Rand> If it's, say, 10 bugs for 5 USD each, per release, that's trivial compared to the what developers' time is worth
21:34:10 <jbisch> I think Alan did it before ATI was formed.
21:34:14 <Jeremy_Rand> and if it saves the devs that time, I'd say it's likely to be useful
21:34:21 <jbisch> Yeah.
21:35:37 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: yeah, if you can ask Goatpig, that'd be awesome
21:35:54 <Jeremy_Rand> hopefully it wouldn't be necessary to bother Alan about that question
21:36:29 <Jeremy_Rand> (unless you think Alan wouldn't mind answering it for you)
21:40:35 <Jeremy_Rand> jbisch: should we put that down as an action item in the minutes for you?
21:41:05 <jbisch> Okay
21:42:04 <Jeremy_Rand> #action jbisch will check with Armory people (probably Goatpig) about whether the beta bug bounty program was effective
21:42:35 <Jeremy_Rand> ok, so that leads us very nicely to our next topic,
21:42:45 <Jeremy_Rand> #topic Funding
21:43:12 <Jeremy_Rand> #info Bountysource was having technical issues this morning, so I couldn't check our balance
21:43:54 <Jeremy_Rand> #info But it looks like our anonymous recurring supporter on Bountysource increased their donation amount again, it's now $15 USD per month
21:44:25 <Jeremy_Rand> So that's good to see
21:44:50 <Jeremy_Rand> #info NMDF hasn't received donations since our previous meeting
21:45:23 <Jeremy_Rand> #info I contacted Phelix about moving NMDF funds to an HD wallet; still waiting on an answer from him
21:46:15 <Jeremy_Rand> As usual, ongoing attempts to get funding shouldn't be discussed in this meeting because reasons
21:47:19 <Jeremy_Rand> But any other funding related topics are welcome
21:47:44 <Jeremy_Rand> any funding related things from you guys?
21:53:22 <Jeremy_Rand> guess not.  Any other topics that anyone would like to bring up before we wrap up the meeting?
21:58:20 <Jeremy_Rand> ok then.  Thanks for being here everyone.
21:58:25 <Jeremy_Rand> #endmeeting
