Meeting summary
---------------
* TLS for Firefox  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:18:56)
  * Right now, tlsrestrict_nss_tool uses certutil to talk to NSS... and
    Mozilla doesn't distribute certutil binaries for Windows
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:19:50)
  * I've finally gotten Tor's rbm descriptors to build certutil for
    Windows.  Turned out to be relatively straightforward; certutil is
    already built, they were just discarding it from the zip archive
    that's outputted  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:21:38)
  * the Tor guys have given a Concept ACK on a patch that adds certutil
    binaries to their official zip archives.  I've sent them a patch for
    review, hopefully they'll be able to review it soon.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:22:28)
  * This means that, asuming they accept the patch, part of Namecoin's
    releases will be reproducibly built by the Tor community.  Yay!
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:23:15)
  * Meanwhile, I might start experimenting with pkcs11 stuff soon.
    Hoping to have something in that department ready for a talk at
    35C3.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:24:45)

* TLS for CryptoAPI  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:32:56)
  * I tried out ECP (Enterprise Certificate Pinning).
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:33:30)
  * ECP definitely appears to work as advertised when I tried it with
    Edge.  Was surprisingly easy to set up.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:34:24)
  * I haven't tried EMET yet.  Looks like EMET went EOL in July 2018, so
    I'm a bit skeptical that supporting EMET is a good idea.  On the
    other hand, EMET is supposed to work with older Windows releases,
    while ECP is Windows 10 only.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:35:33)
  * Interestingly, the EMET installer seems to be blacklisted by Windows
    10.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:35:50)
  * I'm probably going to put EMET and ECP on the back burner for a few
    weeks so I can focus on other areas of dev.  If anyone wants to play
    with either of them, I'm happy to post my notes.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:37:25)

* Funding  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:44:20)
  * ACTION: Now that hl's SPV ncdns bundling milestone is finished, hl
    will look into working on Linux packaging and reproducible build
    milestones for NLnet  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:18:37)
  * HELP: If you're a developer and have some time to work on Namecoin
    stuff, talk to tfreedman  -- there might be some funding available
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:26:21)
  * HELP: Similarly, if you're a developer and have some time to work on
    Namecoin stuff, talk to Jeremy_Rand too.  We have some funding items
    from NLnet that would benefit from another developer.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:30:02)

Meeting ended at 20:35:24 UTC.
