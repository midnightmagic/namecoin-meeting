Meeting summary
---------------
* Namecoin Core  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:09:01)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/201 Windows
    Gitian builds of Namecoin Core were broken; I fixed that.
    nc0.15.99-name-tab-beta2 is expected to have Windows binaries.
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:09:15)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/202 The
    Namecoin Core release process for macOS was outdated, I fixed that.
    nc0.15.99-name-tab-beta2 is expected to have macOS binaries.
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:11:15)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/204 The
    Namecoin Core Windows installer now uses the Namecoin logo instead
    of the Bitcoin logo.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:14:52)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/178 Namecoin
    Core added a new DNS seed, operated by markasoftware.
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:18:21)
  * IDEA: Right now our jurisdictional diversity in DNS seeds isn't very
    good (one German domain name and one American domain name.)  Should
    I ask virus_net whether he's interested in setting up a Russian DNS
    seed?  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:20:33)
  * ACTION: Jeremy_Rand[m] will ask virus_net if he's interested in
    running a DNS seed  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:26:09)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/205 Now that
    macOS builds of Namecoin Core work, macOS has been re-enabled in the
    release process.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:28:53)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/206 Namecoin
    Core's modal overlay (displayed while the blockchain is syncing) now
    properly says Namecoin instead of Bitcoin, and clarifies that name
    updates and name lookups are impacted by the not-synced status.
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:37:58)
  * (hopefully this will reduce the number of people who are confused by
    ncdns not working while the blockchain is still syncing)
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:38:19)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/195 Namecoin
    Core added an onion seed node, operated by redblade7.
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:44:32)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/177 Namecoin
    Core removed broken DNS seeds from Marius and George.  (Thanks to
    markasoftware for the PR.)  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:45:04)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/207 Daniel
    fixed a Travis CI issue in Namecoin Core that I reported.
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:47:43)
  * (Maybe one of these days Travis won't be regularly failing :) )
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:47:55)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/208 I fixed the
    macOS binaries to use the Namecoin logo instead of the Bitcoin logo.
    Thanks to upsuper for testing the fix.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:49:34)
  * HELP: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/issues/194 I posted
    a proposal for modifying the name RPC commands in Namecoin Core;
    review would be appreciated.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:51:41)
  * IDEA:
    https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/issues/108#issuecomment-356084499
    We might want to consider using `revgrep` instead of `csbuild` for
    future static analysis work.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:53:23)
  * HELP:
    https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/187#issuecomment-356158329
    brand0's name tab PR needs a rebase due to merge conflicts against
    current master branch.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:55:40)
  * LINK:
    https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/187#issuecomment-357937535
    I posted some review of brand0's name tab PR based on some testing
    on regtest.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:56:20)
  * HELP: I tagged nc0.15.99-name-tab-beta1 and posted GNU/Linux Gitian
    sigs for it.  midnightmagic has posted sigs as well.  I'd like to
    see one more person post Gitian sigs before I release binaries.
    Anyone able to help with this?  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:58:53)
  * HELP: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/pull/162 Can
    midnightmagic rebase this PR against current master branch?
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 20:00:25)

* Public Relations  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 20:05:39)
  * HELP: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin.org/pull/89 We're
    planning to apply to Google Summer of Code as a mentor organization,
    we could use some help reviewing our Suggested Project Ideas List.
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 20:05:59)
  * HELP: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin.org/issues/214 The FAQ
    has some terminology errors (e.g. "ICANN DNS" and similar), it would
    be great if someone can fix those.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 20:13:26)
  * HELP: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin.org/issues/215 The FAQ
    also has some terminology errors about PGP.  (Jeremy_Rand[m],
    20:13:38)
  * LINK: https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin.org/pull/211 I added a
    "Contribute" page to the Namecoin website.  (Jeremy_Rand[m],
    20:14:12)
