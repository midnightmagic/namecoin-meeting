Meeting summary
---------------
* Electrum-NMC  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:10:54)

    names now works.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:11:59)
  * Also, Neil Booth merged my PR for name script support into upstream
    ElectrumX.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:14:20)

* pkcs11  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:18:02)
  * aerth has been doing some awesome work on a pkcs11 module for
    Namecoin TLS  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:18:34)

    As you might have heard, the New York Times yesterday accused Saudi
    intelligence of being behind the "State Sponsored Actor" Twitter
    attack of 2015 (which targeted my account, along with circa 40 other
    Twitter users, most of whom were privacy tech activists of some
    kind)  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:38:52)
  * I was wondering why exactly Saudi Arabia would be so interested in
    me, seeing as the most high-profile stuff I worked on in the
    2013-2015 period discussed in the article was Namecoin TLS stuff,
    and I wasn't previously aware of Saudi Arabia compromising CA's or
    otherwise doing MITM attacks  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:40:25)
  * LINK: https://moxie.org/blog/saudi-surveillance/ And lookie what I
    found today.  Saudi Arabia contacted Moxie Marlinspike in 2013
    looking for help in doing MITM attacks against Twitter, and they
    specifically mentioned the idea of compromising a CA
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:41:52)
  * So... this fits remarkably well  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:42:48)

Meeting ended at 19:56:48 UTC.
