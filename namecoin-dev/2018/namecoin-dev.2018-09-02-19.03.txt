Meeting summary
---------------
* NLnet  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:09:14)
  * AFAICT 2 of the NLnet milestones are ready for us to claim: "DNS Tor
    Browser" and "Bundle SPV and ncdns"  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:10:20)
  * "DNS Tor Browser" had mostly been working for months, but was
    blocked by broken `DNAME` support in `madns` and `dns-prop279`
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:11:36)
  * `DNAME` was fixed in `madns` and `dns-prop279` for the ncdns v0.0.8
    release, so we can claim the milestone now.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:12:25)
  * "Bundle SPV and ncdns" was also mostly working for months, but was
    blocked by a couple of bugs that broke the ConsensusJ-Namecoin
    installation (specifically cookie authentication and Visual C++
    runtime detection)  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:14:45)
  * both of the "Bundle SPV and ncdns" bugs were also fixed in ncdns
    v0.0.8, so we can claim that milestone now too  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:15:33)
  * the "DNS Tor Browser" and "Bundle SPV and ncdns" milestones are
    currently undergoing a 1-week public accountability period on
    Reddit, the forum, and #namecoin.  If anyone reports bugs during
    that week, then we fix them before filing the claims with NLnet
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:16:56)
  * The next milestones that I'm expecting to be claimable are TLS
    Chrome GNU/Linux, Electrum Currency, and TLS Firefox.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:18:11)
  * TLS Chrome GNU/Linux should be claimable right now AFAICT, but it's
    currently a backup milestone so I need to make sure there's
    developer consensus for upgrading it on the roadmap.  I can't think
    of any reason not to upgrade it.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:19:14)
  * Electrum Currency is borderline claimable now.  Arguably blocked by
    lack of rebranded exchange rate display and broken unit tests in
    Electrum-NMC v3.2.2 (the current release), both of which are fixed
    in master branch.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:20:39)
  * Electrum-NMC v3.2.2.2 is tagged as of today, and should fix the
    exchange rate display and unit tests.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:21:23)
  * Once Electrum-NMC v3.2.2.2 binaries are released, I think the
    Electrum Currency milestone is unambiguously claimable.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:21:56)
  * TLS Firefox is currently claimable except for the fact that
    `tlsrestrict_nss_tool` is unusable on Windows because of no
    `certutil` binaries for it.  I'm coordinating with the Tor folks to
    get `certutil` binaries released.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:23:19)

* 35C3  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:29:23)
  * 35C3 is confirmed to be in Leipzig again; Namecoin intends to have
    some developers attend.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:29:59)
  * We'd been wondering why the heck it was taking so long to announce
    the location.  We found out yesterday why it was taking the CCC so
    long.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:30:45)
  * Turns out that the CCC has been fighting with the Leipzig hotel
    industry.  Apparently the capitalist cartels who run the Leipzig
    hotels decided that 35C3 would be a great chance to jack up prices
    for the week by 500%.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:31:55)
  * Anyway, I do have a hotel room reserved at a sane rate (reserved it
    many months ago).  AFAIK jonasbits and I will be going to 35C3, and
    there might be a slot available for a 3rd Namecoiner to room with
    us.  (There'll also probably be 2 Technoethical people in the room,
    as with last time.)  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:34:57)
  * No word yet on when presale vouchers will start getting distributed.
    Hopefully very soon.  I'm hoping to get a voucher from Technoethical
    same as last year, but if anyone has other voucher-obtaining
    chances, please use them too ðŸ™‚  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:37:05)
  * The Technoethical laptops seem to be fairly inexpensive
    (midnightmagic, 19:41:00)
  * ACTION: midnightmagic will be happy to review stuff
    (midnightmagic, 19:52:34)
  * AGREED: WELCOME TO THE MACHINE  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:53:23)

* Website  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:55:58)
  * ACTION: midnightmagic can help with web content review
    (midnightmagic, 19:56:06)
  * tfreedman has been very busy submitting PR's to the namecoin.org
    repo that need review  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:56:30)
  * HELP: Moar reviewers for tfreedman 's PR's would be greatly
    appreciated  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:57:13)

* Namecoin Core  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:01:30)
  * HELP: If anyone here is reasonably comfortable in C++ and would like
    to code and submit a PR to Namecoin Core for storing queued
    transactions in the wallet, that would help speed things along quite
    nicely.  Domob and brand0 haven't had enough time to get to that
    task yet.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:03:13)
  * HELP: (specifically, the Namecoin Core issue in question is
    https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/issues/233 )
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:06:46)
