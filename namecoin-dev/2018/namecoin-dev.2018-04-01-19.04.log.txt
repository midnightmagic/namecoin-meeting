19:05:33 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> hey everyone, welcome to the meeting.  Sorry we're starting 5 minutes late today
19:06:30 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> It seems that statistically the meetings go a lot better when jonasbits manages them... perhaps jonasbits would be interested in taking on the "meeting coordinator" task for future meetings for a while?
19:07:24 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> Also I know it's a holiday weekend for many of you, so if a lot of people aren't around today, that's totally fine -- enjoy your holiday
19:08:15 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> Can we get a roll call of the people who do happen to be here today instead of hunting for rabbit fetus capsules?
19:51:40 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> okay, I'm going to assume everyone's having a great time eating their delicious chocolate rabbit fetuses and/or pranking people today.  Happy hacking everyone.
