Meeting summary
---------------
* Electrum-NMC  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:07:00)
  * Electrum-NMC's name wallet support is pretty much fully working.  At
    this point we're just waiting for upstream Electrum to tag a
    release, at which point we can tag a release ourselves and collect
    some funds from NLnet.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:07:46)
  * There are, however, some issues with Electrum-NMC and RBF.  At this
    point it looks like Namecoin Core has a bug that breaks RBF for name
    transactions, which means of course that Electrum-NMC can't replace
    name transactions (because ElectrumX can't get Namecoin Core to
    accept those replacements)  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:09:10)
  * I reported that bug to Daniel, he'll look at it when he has some
    free time but it's not super high priority  (Jeremy_Rand[m],
    19:09:30)
  * HELP: if anyone here enjoys C++ coding and has (or wants to get)
    familiarity with the Bitcoin Core and/or Namecoin Core codebase, I
    suspect Daniel would be happy to accept a patch that fixes RBF for
    name transactions  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:10:15)
  * For anyone wondering, the main benefit of RBF for name transactions
    is that, if you fuck up a name update (e.g. using invalid JSON), RBF
    will let you correct the mistake without waiting for the erroneous
    transaction to be mined first  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:11:24)
  * In other Electrum-NMC news, I do intend to get Trezor supported for
    name transactions, but that's currently on the back burner due to
    the ncp11 stuff (which will be covered later in this meeting)
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:13:07)
  * RBF in Electrum-NMC isn't mission-critical at the moment, because
    none of the features in Electrum-NMC that use RBF are enabled by
    default.  So, the fact that Namecoin Core's RBF is broken is
    basically just a nuisance and shouldn't be a blocker to claiming the
    name wallet NLnet funds  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:15:11)
  * (but we'd still like to get that fixed)  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:15:28)
  * aerth points out that the most recent Electrum upstream release was
    in early September, so there's a good chance that a new upstream
    release could be happening soon  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:17:01)
  * AGREED: The RBF bug should be added to the "known issues" list in
    the next Electrum-NMC release  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:36:28)

* ncp11 (formerly known as nctls.so)  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:42:50)
  * ncp11 has successfully gotten Chromium on GNU/Linux to accept a
    (currently hardcoded) self-signed Namecoin TLS cert (specifically
    the cert that's on nf.bit)  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:43:57)
  * I need to clean up the rampant debug output in my code for that,
    then I'll get that pushed to GitHub  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:44:19)
  * Firefox support will be a little bit harder because `mozilla::pkix`
    (the cert validation library in Firefox) doesn't accept end-entity
    trust anchors, so we'll need to create name-constrained CA certs
    instead of end-entity certs.  This isn't exactly difficult, but I
    haven't implemented it yet.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:46:36)
  * current intention is to get ncp11 released in a usable-beta state by
    the time of 35C3  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:55:03)

Meeting ended at 20:38:26 UTC.
