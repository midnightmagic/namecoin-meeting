<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">19:04:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> can we get a roll call of who's here today?
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">19:07:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> well, while we're waiting for people to show up, I'll give a brief summary of what I've been working on lately

<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:11:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">"DNS Tor Browser" had mostly been working for months, but was blocked by broken `DNAME` support in `madns` and `dns-prop279`</span>

<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:14:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">"Bundle SPV and ncdns" was also mostly working for months, but was blocked by a couple of bugs that broke the ConsensusJ-Namecoin installation (specifically cookie authentication and Visual C++ runtime detection)</span>
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">19:15:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">both of the "Bundle SPV and ncdns" bugs were also fixed in ncdns v0.0.8, so we can claim that milestone now too</span>

If anyone reports bugs during that week, then we fix them before filing the claims with NLnet</span>
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">19:18:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">The next milestones that I'm expecting to be claimable are TLS Chrome GNU/Linux, Electrum Currency, and TLS Firefox.</span>
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:19:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">TLS Chrome GNU/Linux should be claimable right now AFAICT, but it's currently a backup milestone so I need to make sure there's developer consensus for upgrading it on the roadmap.  I can't think of any reason not to upgrade it.</span>
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:20:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">Electrum Currency is borderline claimable now.  Arguably blocked by lack of rebranded exchange rate display and broken unit tests in Electrum-NMC v3.2.2 (the current release), both of which are fixed in master branch.</span>
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:21:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">Electrum-NMC v3.2.2.2 is tagged as of today, and should fix the exchange rate display and unit tests.</span>
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:21:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">Once Electrum-NMC v3.2.2.2 binaries are released, I think the Electrum Currency milestone is unambiguously claimable.</span>
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:23:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">TLS Firefox is currently claimable except for the fact that `tlsrestrict_nss_tool` is unusable on Windows because of no `certutil` binaries for it.  I'm coordinating with the Tor folks to get `certutil` binaries released.</span>
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:24:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> So that's where we stand on NLnet claims.  Any questions and/or comments on that before we move on?
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:25:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> Ah, hello.
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:25:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> Yay I made it into the meeting minutes!

<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:27:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> heh, ok
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:27:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:29:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> alright, moving along...

<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:30:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> Nice! Who's going?
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:30:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">We'd been wondering why the heck it was taking so long to announce the location.  We found out yesterday why it was taking the CCC so long.</span>
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:31:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">Turns out that the CCC has been fighting with the Leipzig hotel industry.  Apparently the capitalist cartels who run the Leipzig hotels decided that 35C3 would be a great chance to jack up prices for the week by 500%.</span>
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:34:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#agreed </span><span class="cmdline">Scummy anti-competitive hotel behaviour is scummy</span>
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:34:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">Anyway, I do have a hotel room reserved at a sane rate (reserved it many months ago).  AFAIK jonasbits and I will be going to 35C3, and there might be a slot available for a 3rd Namecoiner to room with us.  (There'll also probably be 2 Technoethical people in the room, as with last time.)</span>
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:36:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> So the hotel room fits five..?
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:37:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">No word yet on when presale vouchers will start getting distributed.  Hopefully very soon.  I'm hoping to get a voucher from Technoethical same as last year, but if anyone has other voucher-obtaining chances, please use them too ðŸ™‚</span>
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:38:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">midnightmagic:</span> yes, it's a fairly large room.  It's exactly the same room as the one we booked last year in fact.  (AFAIK it's the only 5-person room in the building)
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:38:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> ï¿½ah nice.
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:39:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> Well, as usual I doubt I'll be showing up at pretty much any of these sorts of things but I'll be there in spirit.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:41:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">The Technoethical laptops seem to be fairly inexpensive</span>
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:41:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">midnightmagic:</span> one of my friends couldn't make it to a conference, so he asked his friends to carry a sign with his face on it throughout the conference so that he'd be there in spirit.  Should we do that for you?
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:41:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> j/k of course
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:42:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> Hah. You can put my little cthulhu octopus thingy on a business card and hand it out. How soon do we have before the conference?
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:42:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">midnightmagic:</span> it's December 27-30
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:43:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> Plenty of time to have mysterious cardstock printed up.

<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:48:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> Just verifying it didn't miss anything..?
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:49:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> Not certain.  I think a lot of meetings during the last few months got canceled due to schedule constraints.  Hopefully meetings will actually resume being regular from here on out.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:51:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;midnightmagic&gt;</span> Okay, fair enough. Well nothing else from this end.
