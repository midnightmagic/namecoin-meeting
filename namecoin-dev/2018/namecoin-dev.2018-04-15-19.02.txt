Meeting summary
---------------
* LINK: https://rbm.torproject.org   (jonasbits, 19:08:14)
* IDEA: We could start RBM tests with
  https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-build.git/tree/rbm.conf
  and try to build a easy "hello world" project with that.  (jonasbits,
  19:18:38)
* so we're about ready to release ncdns v0.0.6 (release binaries are
  uploaded, just waiting on the announcement PR to be merged to
  namecoin.org)  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:18:48)
* main new things in this release are:  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:19:08)
* 1. Firefox positive override support via cert_override.txt
  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:19:17)
* 2. Chromium/Linux positive override support via NSS certutil
  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:19:37)
* 3. NSS negative overrides via tlsrestrict_nss_tool (technically not
  part of ncdns, but will be integrated into a future ncdns installer
  version)  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:20:21)
* 4. Lots of code quality improvements  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:20:34)
* I should also note that there are currently 2 bugs in ncdns-nsis, each
  of which breaks one of the bundled Namecoin node types
  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:21:30)
* 1. Namecoin Core installer is executed with elevated privs, which
  causes the installer to do wacky stuff like try to use C:\ProgramData\
  as an AppData folder  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:22:17)
* 2. cookie auth is enabled even when ConsensusJ-Namecoin is in use,
  which causes ncdns to error when it can't find the cookie
  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:22:41)
* the first of those issues actually is also a bug in Bitcoin Core.
  I've just submitted yesterday a PR to fix it there.  It got 1 ACK this
  morning, so hopefully it'll pass peer review and then I'll add the fix
  to ncdns-nsis as well  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:23:34)

Meeting ended at 19:34:53 UTC.
