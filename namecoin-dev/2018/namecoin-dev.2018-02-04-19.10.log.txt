19:11:50 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> Hi everyone, welcome to the meeting.  Sorry we're starting a little bit late today.
19:11:57 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> Can we get a roll call of who's here today?
19:14:14 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> Hmm, are people here today?
19:29:48 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> well, I guess no one's here today.  Hopefully everyone's at FOSDEM playing with the Talos II on display there, or something else far more interesting than this meeting
19:29:51 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> Happy hacking all
