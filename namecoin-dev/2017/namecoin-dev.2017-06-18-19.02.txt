Meeting summary
---------------
* ncdns  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:09:12)
  * hl released the Windows installer for ncdns.  (Jeremy_Rand[m],
    19:09:55)
  * This includes Namecoin Core and Dnssec-Trigger, so it's basically
    all you need to view .bit domains on Windows  (Jeremy_Rand[m],
    19:10:39)
  * Doesn't yet include the TLS support, because it wasn't merged at the
    time of release  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:11:18)
  * hl has ACKed the CryptoAPI TLS support for merge, I just need to
    squash the commits and then it'll be merged.  (Jeremy_Rand[m],
    19:12:30)
  * I added a tool to ncdns that sets up the NUMS key pin in Chromium;
    hl has ACKed and merged it.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:13:12)
  * We haven't yet integrated that tool to the NSIS script
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:13:40)
  * I started working on NSS TLS support for ncdns, it basically works
    but it's quite slow because NSS's certutil takes about 700ms to add
    a cert  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:16:14)
  * I figured out that the main reason certutil is so slow is that it
    doesn't group SQLite writes into a single transaction properly
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:16:53)
  * I plan to submit a bug to NSS upstream about that  (Jeremy_Rand[m],
    19:17:05)
  * All of the above ncdns work is thanks to NLnet.  A little bit of it
    is also supported by NMDF and Namecoin Bountysource
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:20:55)

* Tor  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:23:48)
  * As people may remember, I released a fork of OnioNS's Stem component
    a few months ago that enabled Namecoin naming support in Tor.
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:24:44)
  * The OnioNS Stem fork was really proof-of-concept-ish, e.g. it didn't
    support most of the .bit spec, it didn't support the libdohj SPV
    client, and it didn't use the Prop279 spec (instead using the Tor
    controller API)  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:25:31)
  * I've fixed those 3 issues in a new release, this time based on Miek
    Gieben's q tool  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:26:13)
  * The new tool is basically a bridge between Prop279 clients and DNS
    servers.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:27:06)
  * So you can use TorNS by meejah, tell it to use this tool as a
    pluggable naming system, and give this tool ncdns's port+IP, and
    Namecoin naming will work in Tor  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:28:15)
  * There were some licensing issues with TorNS that are now resolved
    (meejah had forgotten to list the license; it's now public domain).
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:29:02)
  * There were also some issues with TorNS restricting the TLD's to
    .onion, which of course doesn't make sense for Namecoin.  meejah is
    willing to accept a PR to remove that restriction; I'll be
    submitting that shortly.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:29:27)
  * (Until that PR is merged, I have a fork called LibreTorNS that
    doesn't have that restriction)  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:29:52)
  * so this tool works for redirecting .bit domains to IP addresses, DNS
    names, and onion services.  It can also redirect .bit.onion domains
    to onion services.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:30:38)
  * Works perfectly fine with the SPV client, and with basically all of
    the .bit spec (except for NS records) -- both of these are because
    it uses ncdns instead of talking directly to Namecoin Core
    (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:31:24)
  * It should be noted that there's no Namecoin-specific code in this
    tool.  You could give it a regular DNS server instead of ncdns, and
    it would let you automatically redirect DNS names to onion services
    (and you could presumably use the ICANN root key as a trust root for
    this if you wanted)  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:33:22)
  * Because it's designed to be interoperable with DNS, that means that
    the way onion services are specified in Namecoin names has changed.
    It no longer uses the "tor" field, it instead uses the "txt" field
    of the "_tor" subdomain  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:34:23)
  * This is consistent with how things are usually done in the DNS
    world.  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:34:44)

* Electrum  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:41:39)
  * ahmed_ has been doing some work on Electrum-NMC  (Jeremy_Rand[m],
    19:42:44)
  * ahmed_ says the next step in Electrum-NMC is getting an electrumX
    instance running and synced with the Namecoin chain, and adding
    AuxPoW verification  (Jeremy_Rand[m], 19:50:26)

Meeting ended at 20:14:28 UTC.
