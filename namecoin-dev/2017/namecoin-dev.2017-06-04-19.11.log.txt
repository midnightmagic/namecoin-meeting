19:12:34 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> Hey everyone, welcome to the meeting.  Can we get a roll call of who's here today?
19:12:42 <midnightmagic> half here but rapidly falling asleep
19:15:39 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> hmm, I hope midnightmagic and I aren't the only ones here?
19:25:08 <Jeremy_Rand[m]> okay, so I guess there's not much point in doing the meeting if a sleepy midnightmagic and I are the only ones here
