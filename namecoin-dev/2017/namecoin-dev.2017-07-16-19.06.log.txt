19:07:26 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> #meetingtopic Namecoin Development Meeting
19:07:44 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Hi everyone, welcome to the meeting
19:07:55 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Can we get a roll call of who's here today?
19:08:03 <hl> Hi.
19:08:12 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: hello!
19:09:51 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Okay, so this meeting will be somewhat less structured than usual, since I'm on an insecure computer that doesn't have my usual notes.
19:10:26 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> #topic Tor
19:11:08 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> I recently got Namecoin naming for Tor working, using Prop279 (the Tor pluggable naming API)
19:12:33 <hl> Excellent.
19:12:52 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> #link https://github.com/namecoin/dns-prop279
19:13:18 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> It's a fork of Miekg's q tool, and it works with any DNS server, not just ncdns
19:13:40 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> So you could use this, if desired, to implement .onion naming via the DNS
19:14:00 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> DNSSEC support isn't yet tested, but should be feasible
19:15:43 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Interestingly, a couple days after I released this, an apparent scammer on BitcoinTalk announced a similar-sounding project.
19:16:11 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> I assume that by now, everyone knows not to download and execute code posted by random newbies on BitcoinTalk
19:17:10 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> I still need to announce this on the tor-dev mailing list, I'll be doing that shortly after I have access to my main computer again
19:17:24 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> I probably should write more documentation first, though
19:19:22 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Anyone have anything else to say about Tor before we move on?
19:20:35 <hl> No.
19:21:25 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> (is brand0 here today?)
19:25:18 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> #topic SPV
19:26:20 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> I've been cleaning up the libdohj and bitcoinj-addons code, aiming to get them merged upstream
19:26:24 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> I've submitted a PR to libdohj that includes the leveldbtxcache algorithm
19:26:29 <hl> Ah, right.
19:26:59 <hl> So I will implement SPV for ncdns-nsis as an install-time option, so we can distribute a single EXE installer. What is your preference for the SPV implementation to be bundled, and is it ready yet?
19:28:39 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> (looks like Ross Nicoll has requested some changes to my PR, I'll deal with those when I'm back on my main computer)
19:29:05 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: the BitcoinJ client listed on the Beta Downloads page of namecoin.org is recommended at the moment (specifically the bleeding-edge branch)
19:29:20 <hl> OK.
19:30:02 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: I'd say it's probably ready for inclusion to ncdns-nsis, but installation is going to be a little bit interesting because there's no installer for the BitcoinJ client right now
19:30:46 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> The build scripts generate a .jar; instructions for how to run it are linked to from the Beta Downloads page
19:31:34 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> I also have no idea whether we have legal rights to distribute the Windows Java installer.  I don't think OpenJDK has official Windows binaries, and I don't know what license Oracle's binaries are under
19:31:57 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> I guess we can just assume that most people have Java already, and if we detect that they don't, we can tell them to install it
19:32:58 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: also note that the BitcoinJ client requires a Visual C++ runtime, I don't recall what version... I'll check that when I'm back on my main computer
19:33:21 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> It's a different runtime version than the BIND tools require
19:35:38 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> switching gears...
19:35:50 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> ahmed_ / jbisch: any news on Electrum?
19:36:40 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> (not sure if they're here today)
19:39:25 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> anyone else have anything to say about SPV before we move on?
19:41:11 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> ok, moving on...
19:41:38 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> #topic Consensus Rules
19:42:35 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> A while back we discussed the issue that removing the BDB lock limit as part of AAA would effectively be a block size increase, which might cause problems with centralization
19:43:03 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> So I actually checked what block size is typical for Namecoin right now
19:43:35 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> and our peak block size in the month before I checked, was something like 33 KiB
19:43:42 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Average was about 3 KiB
19:44:11 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> So basically, there's no reason to increase the block size anytime soon, we're not anywhere near the limit
19:44:43 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> And if we did hit the limit, that would just mean that tx fees go up.  For Namecoin, that's actually a good thing, because it makes squatting more expensive
19:45:37 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Anyway, I talked to Luke-Jr about what block size is actually safe in terms of centralization, and he suggested circa 256 KiB limit
19:45:55 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Which is 8x higher than our peak usage right now
19:46:39 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> So, what I've suggested is, we combine AAA with a softfork that lowers the block size limit to 256 KiB, and have that softfork component sunset after a year
19:47:17 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> There's basically no way that we're going to have our usage increase so much in the next year that the limit becomes a problem, and by sunsetting it after a year, we won't have to hardfork to get rid of it later
19:47:51 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Daniel has ACKed this plan; I'm curious if anyone else has comments on it
19:47:54 <midnightmagic> I don't suppose you have any input from e.g. Bitmain re: their comments about a smaller blocksize for namecoin?
19:48:38 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> midnightmagic: I'm unaware of any Bitmain comments about Namecoin's block size, can you elaborate?
19:48:43 <midnightmagic> Or do any of the poolops care what we do, they're just selling namecoins, no biggie?
19:49:07 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> oh, I see
19:49:22 * Jeremy_Rand_Inse misread midnightmagic's message
19:49:25 <midnightmagic> Bitmain extracts promises from people regarding changes where they have control or some kind of power in the ecosystem to hash-power-veto changes in the consensus layer.
19:50:03 <midnightmagic> Namecoin could be seen by them as an example to use against them re: the Bitcoin .. problems ..
19:50:09 <midnightmagic> Or not. Maybe they don't care.
19:50:15 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> midnightmagic: right -- generally I don't think any of the miners care what softforks we ask them to do, we're not economically relevant enough for them to bother worrying about it
19:50:49 <midnightmagic> Hopefully.
19:50:53 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> But yes, obviously we would need to run all of this by the miners
19:51:20 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> midnightmagic: I've been holding back on talking to miners about AAA until we actually have code ready for them to test.
19:51:32 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> The intention is to have Namecoin Testnet activate AAA before mainnet, and ask all the major pools to mine Namecoin Testnet and make sure that it works okay for their setups
19:52:05 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> But yeah -- generally I don't think anyone will be able to use Namecoin's block size as an argument about Bitcoin's block size
19:52:17 <hl> What's AAA again?
19:52:20 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> It's pretty clear that Bitcoin can't work with a block size of 256 KiB, due to tx volume (unless Lightning were factored in, which isn't a thing for Namecoin)
19:52:38 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: the hardfork to make AuxPoW work with VersionBits
19:52:45 <hl> Ah.
19:52:55 <hl> It stands for what, exactly?
19:53:08 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: AlwaysAuxpowActive
19:53:11 <hl> Ah.
19:53:14 <midnightmagic> ha ha
19:55:15 <midnightmagic> Bitcoin couldn't work at 256KB in any event. It would break *soooooo* much. ha ha..
19:56:00 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> the GitHub issue for this discussion is https://github.com/namecoin/meta/issues/45 if anyone's interested
19:56:55 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> midnightmagic: what would break in Bitcoin at 256 KiB?  It would definitely make fees go really high ... but for Namecoin that's actually a good thing (squatting)
19:59:04 <midnightmagic> #link https://github.com/namecoin/meta/issues/45 Decrease the block size limit issue
20:00:03 <midnightmagic> Jeremy_Rand_Inse: Massive legacy software breakage, huge, massive public freak-out, huge political ramifications, horrorshow at every turn.
20:01:00 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> midnightmagic: fair enough.  I guess those don't have much effect on us?
20:01:21 <midnightmagic> No, thank god. We're still at the stage where things can be changed here.
20:01:37 <midnightmagic> The world's our oyster, sir!
20:02:38 <midnightmagic> #agreed The world (of development possibilities) is our oyster!
20:03:05 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Actually, I do recall one case where some big-block activists cited Namecoin's AuxPoW hardfork as an example of why Bitcoin could pull off a hardfork without any trouble
20:03:31 <midnightmagic> I'll guess that fell basically flat and nobody cared.
20:03:50 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> midnightmagic: yeah, I think no one cared
20:05:06 <midnightmagic> They spout things and measure to see what sticks, and then harp on the stuff that does forever.
20:05:23 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> (and of course, the only reason why Namecoin did the AuxPoW hardfork was because there was an imminent thread of a 51% attack, and even with that, the AuxPoW hardfork didn't go that well)
20:05:47 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Like, they had to change the block height target after it was already scheduled
20:07:13 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> anyway -- anyone have anything else to say about AAA and/or the block size before we move on?
20:07:29 <midnightmagic> No, sir.
20:09:22 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> ok, moving on...
20:09:25 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> #topic Public Relations
20:10:10 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> So I spent the past week at GCER 2017 (which, happily, was in Norman this year, so I didn't have to do any travel)
20:10:56 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> My talk went very well.  The main goal was to try to generate interest among the students there, in the hopes that we get to recruit some awesome students to work on Namecoin
20:11:13 <midnightmagic> Awesome!
20:12:05 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> One of the students who was at my talk told me afterwards that he's going to share info about Namecoin on the internal channels that his team uses to talk to about 7-8 other teams (all of those teams are among the top-performing teams in the world)
20:13:09 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> also I met a couple of NASA interns there who think Namecoin sounds really cool.  Also I met the CEO of an IoT startup who also thinks Namecoin sounds really cool.
20:14:13 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Anyway yeah -- definitely a productive week I'd say
20:16:09 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> so, yeah, I think that's all I was planning to bring up today.  hl, anything you'd like to bring up today?
20:16:18 <hl> Sure.
20:16:21 <hl> #topic ncdns
20:16:40 <hl> As you know, we intend to package ncdns for two Linux distributions pursuant to the nlnet MoU.
20:16:55 <hl> In order to maximise the utility of this, we should do those packages for the most popular distributions.
20:17:04 <hl> This basically means packaging for deb-based distros and rpm-based distros.
20:17:19 <midnightmagic> Hopefully Ubuntu is one of them? Did anybody say they'd accept it upstream or are you doing it as an independent ppa?
20:17:35 <hl> Both Debian and Fedora, as far as I am aware, have tiresome conventions regarding the packaging of Go code.
20:17:43 <midnightmagic> ah
20:18:21 <hl> This involves converting every single Go repository into a deb/rpm package. Since all Go binaries are statically linked, this is extremely senseless, and these packages are basically /usr/src packages of code which form part of a GOPATH (search path) used when building Go packages for distribution packaging.
20:19:17 <hl> Really, they could accomplish the same thing by keeping a file of commit hashes by repository with their packaging control files.
20:19:34 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: in terms of which distros we support, I'd favor considering as candidates any distro endorsed by PRISM-Break, any distro endorsed by FSF, and also Ubuntu and Mint (even though I hate Ubuntu and Mint, they're popular enough that they can't be ignored)
20:20:00 <hl> At any rate, by packaging according to these conventions we lose control of the versions of Go library code against which ncdns, even libraries I maintain.
20:20:05 <hl> *ncdns links.
20:20:33 <hl> And we restrict the update cadence of those libraries, as with ncdns, to the often extremely conservative cadence of such distros.
20:20:58 <hl> IMO, this creates a high packaging and workload overhead for zero benefit, but since it's distribution policies, our options are basically this:
20:21:12 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: FWIW, I suspect that most distros won't be willing to offer ncdns in their official repos unless Namecoin Core is offered as well
20:21:15 <hl> - eschew these silly policies and maintain our own PPA, or
20:21:27 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> And Namecoin Core is difficult to package officially for the same reasons that Bitcoin Core is
20:21:30 <hl> - do packaging according to these policies with the ambition of eventual inclusion in main package repositories
20:22:00 <hl> Really hoping those present will support me doing the former.
20:22:04 <hl> :P
20:22:21 <midnightmagic> +1 maintaining your own PPA.
20:22:32 <midnightmagic> And making sure to link it to the main project website.
20:22:42 <hl> OK.
20:23:04 <midnightmagic> (So a chain of some sort of authority can be used to help ensure that the PPA isn't "just some rando doing it."
20:23:12 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: I prefer to try to follow official distro guidelines except when there's a strong reason not to.  Namecoin Core's issues qualify as a strong reason IMO.
20:23:46 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> I don't know whether Go's issues qualify -- is there an existing precedent that we can cite (e.g. a well-respected privacy project)?
20:23:49 <hl> Yes.
20:24:17 <hl> Not sure. But Bitcoin Core is very particular about what shared library versions they link with for security reasons, no?
20:24:57 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: Bitcoin Core's devs are of the opinion that the major GNU/Linux distros don't perform sufficient QA testing to be safe for consensus protocols
20:25:10 <hl> Since Go binaries are statically linked, Debian/Fedora's insistence on using a communal /usr/src pool full of potentially dated library versions provides zero actual benefit, and substantial risk.
20:25:13 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Hence they statically link everything that's consensus-critical
20:28:54 <midnightmagic> :-o
20:29:21 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: generally I don't think I'll be able to endorse an exception to distro policy on the vague grounds of "outdated software is insecure", unless we can cite a reason why ncdns is unusually affected by this
20:29:37 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> People who want up-to-date software don't usually use Debian
20:29:51 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> And Fedora is usually up to date anyway
20:30:21 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> (actually, Debian users who want up-to-date software do exist, but they use backports and/or sid)
20:32:01 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: all that said -- I don't think most distros will be willing to package ncdns, and therefore I don't think they'll be willing to package its dependencies for the sake of ncdns
20:32:27 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> As a result, I'm probably fine with maintaining up-to-date PPA's for all of ncdns's dependencies that aren't already packages
20:33:18 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> As long as those PPA's are in a form that is compatible with the distro's guidelines, I'm fine with having those PPA's use an up-to-date version of those dependencies
20:34:23 <hl> Okay, but you're talking about one Debian package per github repository referenced in any import statement.
20:34:45 <hl> Each needing to be maintained and updated in lockstep with the repository.
20:36:13 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: yes.  FWIW, that's not that far from what we'd have to do to build reproducibly anyway (each dependency needs to be retrievable in a reproducible way)
20:36:54 <hl> You can do that with a file mapping repositories to commit hashes. It accomplishes the same thing with a fraction of the overhead.
20:37:31 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> All that said... the Tor folks are distributing Go code as part of TBB.  What are they doing at the moment for packaging?  Last I checked TBB isn't even packaged at all
20:38:05 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> hl: how much extra overhead is there, if we use a script to convert the commit hashes and repo URL's into packages?
20:38:09 <hl> In fact, hashes are far more specific than (package name, min package version, max package version) specifiers.
20:38:15 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> Surely that's something people do regularly?
20:40:25 <hl> Not sure yet.
20:41:15 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> https://github.com/Debian/dh-make-golang , https://wiki.debian.org/MichaelStapelberg/GoPackaging , and https://pkg-go.alioth.debian.org/packaging.html seem relevant
20:50:58 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> ok, so let's defer this decision until we can better evaluate what the procedure for meeting Debian's requirements is.
20:51:14 <hl> OK.
20:53:01 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> anything else about ncdns to bring up?
20:54:09 <hl> No.
20:54:34 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> ok.  hl: any other topics to bring up?
20:54:37 <hl> No.
20:54:53 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> ok.  midnightmagic, anything you'd like to bring up today?
20:56:12 <midnightmagic> Not I.
20:57:17 <Jeremy_Rand_Inse> ok.  Thanks for being here.
