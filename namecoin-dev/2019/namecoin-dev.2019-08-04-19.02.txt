Meeting summary
---------------
* Softfork Schedule  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:08:28)
  * We've notified 86.2% of hashrate about the upcoming softfork.  14.5%
    has already confirmed that they've upgraded; I expect that number to
    climb quickly.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:10:25)
  * The mining pools that we haven't talked to yet are Poolin, Bixin,
    Prohashing, and BitMinter.  None of those pools have a public email
    address, so contacting them is less fun.  There are also a small
    number of mining pools that we can't identify from coinbase parsing,
    but IIRC they're less than 1% hashrate combined, so I'm not going to
    bother trying to track that 1% down.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:11:44)
  * For reference, the softfork activates P2SH, CSV, and SegWit.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:13:06)
  * The softfork is expected to activate in a little bit over 2 months
    from now.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:13:06)
  * Note that because P2SH and SegWit repurpose the semantics of
    scriptPubKeys that were previously considered "anyone can spend",
    there is an incentive for miners to try to get away with mischief if
    a lot of users haven't upgraded their full nodes  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:20:03)
  * So, I strongly recommend that anyone running Namecoin Core who
    doesn't need the name management GUI should upgrade to 0.18.0 as
    soon as possible.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:20:42)

* Miscellaneous Golang Project Updates  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:23:55)
  * I've successfully split out Namecoin's fork of `crypto/x509` into
    its own repo.  This allows ncdns's repo to be revised independently
    of the Golang compiler version.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:25:37)
  * This is a critical step towards integrating with Tor's build system.
    I haven't yet configured ncdns-repro or tor-browser-build to use
    this, but it should be pretty easy.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:26:40)
  * I've also successfully gotten ncdns to work with a current release
    of Conformal's btcd RPC client library, instead of the stupid
    4-year-old heavily-patched fork that we weren't maintaining.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:27:46)
  * One of the patches we were carrying wasn't relevant anymore (only
    mattered for ancient Core versions); another was fixed upstream long
    ago (ConsensusJ and Electrum support); the last one I've submitted
    upstream for review (cookie authentication support)
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:29:08)
  * I did need to submit a patch upstream to Conformal that changes 3
    API symbols from private to exported, so that we can add
    Namecoin-specific RPC calls.  It's submitted, hopefully they'll look
    at it soon.  If they don't get to it soon, we can probably maintain
    our own fork for a while (it's a trivial patch).  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:30:59)
  * Currently the new Namecoin RPC client package exposes `NameShow`,
    `NameScan`, and `NameQuery`, the last one of which is like
    `NameShow` but only returns the value without the metadata.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:32:06)
  * As a side effect of this refactor, `ncdt` and `ncdumpzone` now
    support cookie authentication.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:32:56)
  * Meanwhile, I started doing reproducibility testing on ncdns.  It
    turns out that we're not reproducible right now.  I traced the bug
    via Diffoscope, and found that there's a bug in upstream rbm.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:34:31)
  * Specifically, upstream rbm contaminates tar.gz files with timestamps
    as part of the gzip header  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:34:58)
  * I tried switching to tar.xz and that was reproducible, so that's a
    short-term fix.  I chatted with Nicolas from Tor about the issue,
    and he helped me code up a patch that fixes tar.gz; I've submitted
    that and it's awaiting review.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:36:04)
  * I also addressed Nicolas's feedback on the Golang build script
    refactor patch; it's now awaiting review as well.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:37:08)
  * One more thing: documentation is now written for using ncp11 with
    Tor Browser.  So we're very very close to a release of ncp11.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:40:56)

* Electrum-NMC  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:07:18)
  * The primary blocker from Tor's perspective at this point is stream
    isolation for name lookups in Electrum-NMC, along with the plumbing
    to get Tor to pass its stream isolation data through to
    Electrum-NMC.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:10:07)
  * I've started discussing with the upstream Electrum devs about how
    they want this to be done.  I'm hoping to have a patch submitted
    upstream within a couple weeks, along with a Namecoin-specific patch
    for the parts that aren't applicable to Bitcoin.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    20:10:14)
  * The initial patch will probably have performance issues, because it
    will do a TCP handshake + TLS handshake + Electrum handshake
    on-demand each time a new stream ID is opened.  The "right way" to
    handle this is to preemptively open connections for use by
    stream-isolated RPC commands, but doing this safely without side
    channel leaks is complicated, and I'm probably not going to bother
    with that until after  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:12:07)
  * Meanwhile, I'm happy to report that I'm no longer the only active
    Electrum-NMC developer.  Xaya is funding Daniel to do Electrum-NMC
    development now; he's already sent in some PR's.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    20:14:52)
  * It also looks like there's a chance we can get Xaya to sponsor the
    SegVal scalability work for Namecoin.  Daniel informs me that SegVal
    is similar enough to some stuff that Xaya wants, that it's likely
    that SegVal can share a lot of implementation code with Xaya.  No
    confirmation on this yet though.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:16:22)

* Public Relations  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:26:14)
  * You've probably by now seen the media circus about OpenNIC following
    the recommendation from me and PRISM Break lead maintainer Yegor
    Timoshenko to remove .bit from their root zone.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    20:27:05)
  * A journalist from ZDNet.fr (who's interviewed me before) asked me
    for a comment on the subject; I replied with a quite
    extensive/detailed statement including a timeline of relevant events
    and various other analysis.  I'm very glad I did, because his
    article on the subject turned out great IMO.

    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:29:19)

* Testnet  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:41:41)
  * Testnet is missing a dnsseed to bootstrap new clients joining... its
    possible to re-join by using an IP adress of a Testnet node.. but i
    currently dont know of any  (jonasbits, 20:43:16)
