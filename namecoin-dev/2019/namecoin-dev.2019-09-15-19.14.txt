Meeting summary
---------------
* Electrum-NMC packaging  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:17:07)
  * Debian Sid and Debian Bullseye now have an updated Electrum
    (Bitcoin) package.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:17:43)
  * Lola is looking into porting that package for Electrum-NMC
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:18:15)
  * If she succeeds at that, I'll ask mhatta if he can get it uploaded
    as an official Debian package  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:19:00)

* ncdns-repro  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:22:22)
  * ncdns-repro now supports arbitrary Go compiler versions.  This means
    that we can independently upgrade the tor-browser-build dependency
    and the x509-signature-splice dependency, rather than forcing them
    to be kept in lockstep  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:25:18)
  * ncdns-repro now also produces DNSSEC-HSTS binaries that can be
    transformed into a .crx Chromium/Chrome extension.  This should
    allow us to release DNSSEC-HSTS for Chrome.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:26:49)
  * I updated qlib to properly handle current versions of Miek's DNS
    library.  This allowed me to remove a bunch of stupid hackery in
    ncdns-repro that dealt with handling 2 different miekg/dns revisions
    at once.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:27:50)
  * And, the big two things...  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:28:32)
  * ncprop279 now builds inside the tor-browser-build tree (this is
    merged to ncdns-repro and my tor-browser-build fork), and
    Electrum-NMC now builds from source (including building all of its
    Python dependencies from source) inside the tor-browser-build tree
    as well (this will be merged to ncdns-repro and my tor-browser-build
    fork as soon as I verify that it builds okay in a standalone
    ncdns-repro tree)  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:30:26)
  * Building ncprop279 and Electrum-NMC from source were two of the
    major blockers for getting into the Tor Browser nightly builds.
    With those out of the way, the path is substantially cleared.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:31:15)

* Funding  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:53:26)
  * We're approaching the end of our funding from the NLnet Internet
    Hardening Fund.  (The amount of funding remaining is IIRC somewhere
    in the realm of 4000 EUR, though I don't have the numbers in front
    of me.)  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:55:23)
  * Once that funding ends, we will put together a new funding proposal
    and try to get new funding.  So, I suggest that people start
    brainstorming ideas on what projects we should ask for funding for.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:56:56)
  * Our current NLnet funding is fairly limited in scope (everything
    funded by that pool of money has to be TLS related).  Our next
    funding proposal is unlikely to be as constrained.  So there are
    things that we weren't able to get funded last time, that we could
    potentially fund soon.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:58:15)
  * Given that we'll still have funding from Cyphrs, Xaya, and NMDF
    after the current NLnet funding ends, it's unlikely that we'll see
    significant disruption to our operations while we're looking for new
    funding.  However, since funding proposals tend to get handled by
    me, it does mean that I'll be spending less time on code and more
    time on getting new funding.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:00:40)

Meeting ended at 20:12:27 UTC.
