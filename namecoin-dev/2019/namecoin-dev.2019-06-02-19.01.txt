Meeting summary
---------------
* Namecoin Core  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:07:31)
  * Gitian binaries of Namecoin Core 0.18.0 are being built as I write
    this  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:08:36)
  * GNU/Linux binaries are already built; it's doing Windows binaries
    now; macOS binaries will be done after Windows finishes
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:09:37)
  * HELP: It would be great if other people volunteered to build Gitian
    binaries of Namecoin Core 0.18.0 as well.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:11:43)
  * It occurred to me that while the name registration GUI (what
    Electrum-NMC calls the Buy Names tab) is blocked by adding new
    wallet RPC commands, I'm pretty sure that the other name GUI
    components (what Electrum-NMC calls the Manage Names tab) isn't
    blocked by anything right now.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:15:55)
  * So, it might be productive to add the Manage Names tab to Namecoin
    Core master branch, without worrying about the Buy Names tab for
    now.  This would help a lot of users.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:17:05)

* TLS  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:23:37)
  * You might have noticed that Tor Browser 8.5 exited alpha and is now
    stable.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:24:16)
  * This is cool for us, since Tor Browser 8.5 includes Namecoin's
    certutil Windows/macOS patch  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:25:11)
  * I'm in the process of refactoring `tor-browser-build`'s Go build
    scripts.  The intent is to make it more straightforward to build Go
    executables in the same way that Go libraries can be built.  I
    intend to submit this upstream to Tor; `ncdns-repro` will then be
    altered to use that code, which should make ncdns-repro's code a lot
    cleaner.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:36:05)
  * grringo has been working on code refactoring/cleanup for
    DNSSEC-HSTS; those changes are now awaiting review
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:47:22)

Meeting ended at 20:29:45 UTC.
