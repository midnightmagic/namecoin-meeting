<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:17:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> oh cool, and the tornado is headed in this direction too
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:19:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">TheJollyRoger:</span> if I gave you instructions for doing Gitian builds, would you be up for trying it out?  It's not particularly difficult for someone who's competent enough to install Gentoo and who uses GPG
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:20:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> I would be!
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:20:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Oh. Oh crap.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:21:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> I can't do it on my desktop build, but I can spin you up a Fedora or Debian ppc64 virtual machine.

<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:21:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> (Oh crap about the Tornado) -- keep us posted, eh? I hope everything will be alright.
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:22:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Specifically:</span> https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building.md and https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/blob/nc0.18.0/doc/release-process.md  .  Unfortunately it doesn't work in ppc64le yet, you'd have to use an x86_64 machine
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:24:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Okay! Ah SHOOT and I gotta get that reproducible build harness and Tor Browser built &gt;_&lt;. Sorry... I'm really behind on that X(
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:25:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">TheJollyRoger:</span> if you only have time for 1, building Namecoin Core is somewhat higher priority from our end than building Tor Browser
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:26:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Okay!
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:27:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> I remember I got as far as trying to build one of the dependencies and got stuck. I'll go back at it in a bit. I'm hoping to try to get better work hours at my day job, so I'm optimistic I may get more free time in the future.
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:27:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">TheJollyRoger  will (maybe) do a Gitian build of Namecoin Core</span>
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:28:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Okay!
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:28:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> Any opinions on whether I should ask on Reddit for volunteers to do Gitian builds for us?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:29:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Hmm. More hands and eyes might help, but I don't know what the downsides might be.
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:38:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">TheJollyRoger:</span> no particular downsides, besides (1) risk of wasting time helping users who aren't technically skilled enough to make it work easily; (2) if all of the volunteers are compromised by the same adversary, then they could produce reproducibly malicious binaries (though those binaries wouldn't match mine, so it would trigger an investigation rather than posting bad binaries)
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:39:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Got it. Hmm. I'm not sure, this is not something I've ever thought about.
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:40:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> My inclination is to ask on Reddit; it might have the beneficial side effect of getting more people involved in Namecoin dev generally
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:41:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> Would also introduce gitian and the process to many. Would be good educational/learning experience for many.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:43:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cannon-c:</span> yes, definitely.  Tinkering with Gitian is how I got the skill set that I'm now using to port Tor Browser to ARM/POWER.
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:43:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> for those who have not done such a thing before. And getting more people to be involved with it would create more contingency.
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:44:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> For disadvantage #2, I think that the more people there are, the more likelyhood that a mismatching sig would be noticed?
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:45:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Woah.
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:45:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> I think that such an attack would be made harder with the more people involved? Since such would be more likely noticed?
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:46:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> sorry for repeat. Lag on my side.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:46:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cannon-c:</span> if the samples are representative of the same population, then yes.  However, people responding to a Reddit thread are likely to be somewhat less technically sophisticated than people responding to a comment in this channel, so there's a higher risk of those people being compromised.
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:47:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> Generally I do think it's a beneficial tradeoff, all things considered
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:48:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> Good points. but I am sure that most people whom would volunteer would be a mix of people from different regions, and hardware and software. Diversity is good for security in some cases. So maybe posting on reddit would enhance the diversity of such possibly.
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:49:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cannon-c:</span> yes, I agree
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:49:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> If more people on reddit are less technical. It would be also good opportunity to get them to become more active in technical things. Yes pros/cons for sure.
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:49:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Whew. Okay!
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:49:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> just my opinions/thoughts
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:50:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> Sounds like we have a general consensus here in favor of asking on Reddit?
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:50:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> and even if people doing it are more likely to be compromised, then at least attacks would be easier to notice. Think of it like a canary of the existence of an adversary
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:51:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> even if majority has sigs for bad builds, even the minority of something different would still raise questions, right?
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:53:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cannon-c[m]&gt;</span> *even if majority generates sigs for bad builds
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:53:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Huh. It'd give a good way to test the reproducibility, that's for sure.
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:53:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> And our supply lines.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:53:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">cannon-c:</span> I would probably veto publishing binaries that didn't match my hashes prior to an investigation into what happened.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:54:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> I don't know what upstream Bitcoin Core's policies are on this question
