Meeting summary
---------------
* Electrum-NMC  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:15:22)
  * I've been spending most of my dev time in the last week or so trying
    to optimize the bandwidth usage of Electrum-NMC  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:15:58)
  * AuxPoW truncation for block heights that are covered by a checkpoint
    is merged to ElectrumX master branch; I'm waiting for ElectrumX to
    tag a release, and then I'll pester the server operators to upgrade
    and then I'll merge the change to Electrum-NMC  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:17:19)
  * I've also been talking with Neil from ElectrumX about switching the
    Electrum protocol to CBOR rather than the current JSON; he's
    interested in the possibility and he's already started coding it.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:18:11)
  * One of the Electrum devs also pointed out that Bitcoin block headers
    can be compressed (e.g. stripping out the previous hash and bits
    fields); I might try to implement that too  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:18:59)
  * And I'm also halfway through porting Electron-Cash's checkpoint code
    to Electrum; once that's finished, looking up a name in a
    checkpointed height should use almost no bandwidth
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:20:03)
  * Also a new release of Electrum-NMC (v3.3.3.1) is ready; binaries are
    uploaded and the release commit for namecoin.org should be going
    live later today.  This release is the first Windows-compatible
    release that supports name operations.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:22:43)

* Public Relations  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:23:19)
  * I posted the video/transcript/report/slides from IGF 2018 on
    Namecoin.org  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:23:56)
  * I also made an initial attempt to contact one of the contributors to
    the Wikipedia article on Namecoin, to report a misreporting of the
    results of the crappy Princeton study.  No answer yet.
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:25:27)

* Meetings  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:55:28)

Meeting ended at 20:02:36 UTC.
