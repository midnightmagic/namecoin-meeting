<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">19:04:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> Can we get a roll call of who's here today?

<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">19:21:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Ahoy!
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:21:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Ahoy Jeremy_Rand_Talo!
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">19:21:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Sorry about that. Woah, almost missed it X(.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:21:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> Hi TheJollyRoger
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">19:22:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> My uh... I broke my Ricochet again, so I'll try to get that fixed soon, sorry &gt;_&lt;.
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">19:25:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> Anyway, this is likely to be a short meeting, unless anyone else has news that I'm not aware of
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">19:25:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hl&gt;</span> hi

<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:26:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">I've slowly been reviewing hl 's ncdns-repro repo</span>
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:27:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hl:</span> as mentioned on GitHub, it's not clear to me why all of ncdns's subpackages are bundled into one rbm project.  Usually tor-browser-build seems to build each Go executable binary in a separate project.
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:32:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hl:</span> was the motive there just "easiest to prototype since it's most similar to our pre-rbm build scripts"?  Or was there another reason?
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:32:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Jeremy_Rand_Talo:</span> I don't think it makes any difference...
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:33:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hl:</span> well, it makes some difference if a user only wants to build a subset of the binaries.  Also staying closer to tor-browser-build decreases the cognitive load required to audit it
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:34:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hl&gt;</span> not sure how it's any harder to audit, and it would just increase the maintenance burden
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:39:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hl:</span> basically, any non-zero diff between our Go projects and tor-browser-build's means that a human needs to determine whether that diff matters.  Even minor diffs that don't matter can accumulate into something that requires more cognitive load than I enjoy spending on auditing things.  That said, it occurs to me that upstream Tor seems to have a built-in build script (in the go project) for Go libraries, but
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:39:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> they don't seem to have one for Go executables.  Maybe it would be productive to get a Go executable built-in build script merged upstream, so that we don't need a build script at all for ncdns?  (Seems like that would benefit upstream too.)
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:42:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;TheJollyRoger&gt;</span> Hmm...
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:42:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hl&gt;</span> hm
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:42:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hl&gt;</span> the ncdns package isn't upstream anyway, so its entire contents is a diff
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:43:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hl:</span> yeah, but the ncdns build script can be diffed against obfs4's or meek's build script to determine what we changed compared to upstream
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:43:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> Since they're both Go projects, the build scripts are relatively similar
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:45:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> (This would shrink to a zero diff if we got a patch merged upstream that moves that build script to the go project)
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:45:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> Which I suspect is easily achievable
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:51:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hl:</span> I can possibly look into submitting that upstream, though I'm mostly booked this week so it'll probably have to wait till circa Monday of next week
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:53:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> (That's all I had about ncdns-repro, should we move onto the next topic?)
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:54:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hl&gt;</span> ok

<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:58:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">This is, theoretically, superfluous for Namecoin, because Namecoin Core already maintains such an index.</span>
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:58:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">(Specifically, Namecoin Core has an index mapping names to transactions)</span>

<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">20:01:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">Instead, ElectrumX indexes by a hash of the name, so you can request a nonexistent name from an ElectrumX server without revealing the name</span>
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">20:01:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">This should be fixable in Namecoin Core.  It would be nice if Namecoin Core indexed names by their hash, so that we could do lookups by name hash.</span>
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">20:02:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">We could then do useful things like removing the name index from ElectrumX and instead just pass through name lookups from ElectrumX directly to Namecoin Core, which would decrease resource usage considerably.</span>

<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">20:06:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">Upon chatting with luke-jr about this, I think it's reasonable to add a Namecoin wire protocol command that does a name lookup by name hash, and returns the relevant transaction along with a Merkle proof.</span>
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">20:07:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">We could also rig Namecoin Core to automatically issue that wire protocol command if the headers are synced but the full chain isn't yet.  Which would basically mean that Namecoin Core is usable for name lookups quite quickly after launch (though at SPV security) before the chain is synced.</span>
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">20:08:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">This approach would probably be a lot more resistant to DDoS attacks, simply because there are a lot more Namecoin Core nodes than Namecoin ElectrumX servers (due to ElectrumX needing a lot more resources to run), and therefore a DDoS attack would need to take out a lot more nodes</span>
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">20:11:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">There are also probably some cool enhancements we could do do that wire protocol command, e.g. utilizing Ryan's "unconfirmed transaction chains" idea so that if the chain is verified within 36 kiloblocks of the tip, the command could return a chain of transactions (starting with the last verified one), and we would just verify signatures of the tx chain so that we could be relatively confident that the</span>
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">20:11:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> miners didn't invent a name tx out of thin air
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">20:14:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hl:</span> any opinions on the above?

<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">20:16:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hl&gt;</span> hmm, sounds good
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">20:21:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> alright then.  Any C++ coders want to volunteer for the relevant Core changes, or should I just dump this on Daniel's desk?  🙂
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">20:23:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Jeremy_Rand_Talo&gt;</span> (Hypothetically, we might be able to apply for funding for this kind of work if we wait a bit, and I think all of us have other things we're currently busy with, so it's not really a problem if no one wants to code this up immediately)
