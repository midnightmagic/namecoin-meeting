Meeting summary
---------------
* ncdns-repro  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:26:07)
  * I've slowly been reviewing hl 's ncdns-repro repo
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:26:54)

* SPV Name Lookups  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:54:56)
  * So, a large fraction of the Electrum-NMC network is currently down
    due to being hosted on machines that also host Bitcoin ElectrumX
    servers, which are currently under a large DDoS attack
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:55:54)
  * This leads to questions about exactly why we need ElectrumX servers
    to do name lookups, and whether there are preferable ways to handle
    it  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:57:23)
  * Usually, the role of ElectrumX servers is to maintain indexes (e.g.
    mapping addresses to transactions)  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:57:55)
  * This is, theoretically, superfluous for Namecoin, because Namecoin
    Core already maintains such an index.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:58:17)
  * (Specifically, Namecoin Core has an index mapping names to
    transactions)  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:58:44)
  * The main reason we're not using Namecoin Core's name index in
    ElectrumX is that we don't want nonexistent names to be directly
    revealed to the network (because that produces a squatting
    vulnerability)  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:00:05)
  * Instead, ElectrumX indexes by a hash of the name, so you can request
    a nonexistent name from an ElectrumX server without revealing the
    name  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:01:00)
  * This should be fixable in Namecoin Core.  It would be nice if
    Namecoin Core indexed names by their hash, so that we could do
    lookups by name hash.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:01:47)
  * We could then do useful things like removing the name index from
    ElectrumX and instead just pass through name lookups from ElectrumX
    directly to Namecoin Core, which would decrease resource usage
    considerably.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:02:28)
  * This would also probably enable things like Electrum Personal
    Server, which by its nature doesn't keep indexes.  (I haven't
    checked that in detail though.)  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:03:23)
  * Allowing Namecoin Core's name index to be directly used for this
    purpose would also allow interesting things like adding a Namecoin
    wire protocol command for name lookups.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    20:04:12)
  * Upon chatting with luke-jr about this, I think it's reasonable to
    add a Namecoin wire protocol command that does a name lookup by name
    hash, and returns the relevant transaction along with a Merkle
    proof.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:06:05)
  * We could also rig Namecoin Core to automatically issue that wire
    protocol command if the headers are synced but the full chain isn't
    yet.  Which would basically mean that Namecoin Core is usable for
    name lookups quite quickly after launch (though at SPV security)
    before the chain is synced.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:07:39)
  * This approach would probably be a lot more resistant to DDoS
    attacks, simply because there are a lot more Namecoin Core nodes
    than Namecoin ElectrumX servers (due to ElectrumX needing a lot more
    resources to run), and therefore a DDoS attack would need to take
    out a lot more nodes  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:08:45)
  * There are also probably some cool enhancements we could do do that
    wire protocol command, e.g. utilizing Ryan's "unconfirmed
    transaction chains" idea so that if the chain is verified within 36
    kiloblocks of the tip, the command could return a chain of
    transactions (starting with the last verified one), and we would
    just verify signatures of the tx chain so that we could be
    relatively confident that the  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:11:26)
  * ACTION: Jeremy will add "Make Core index names by hash" and "Add
    getname to wire protocol" to Roadmap and bring to Daniel's attention
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 20:34:24)
