<h3>Meeting summary</h3>
<ol>
<li><b class="TOPIC">Softfork Schedule</b> <span class="details">(<a href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-12'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>, 19:08:28)</span>
<ol type="a">
  <li><span class="INFO">We've notified 86.2% of hashrate about the
    upcoming softfork.  14.5% has already confirmed that they've
    upgraded; I expect that number to climb quickly.</span> <span
    class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-13'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:10:25)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">The mining pools that we haven't talked to yet
    are Poolin, Bixin, Prohashing, and BitMinter.  None of those pools
    have a public email address, so contacting them is less fun.  There
    are also a small number of mining pools that we can't identify from
    coinbase parsing, but IIRC they're less than 1% hashrate combined,
    so I'm not going to bother trying to track that 1% down.</span>
    <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-15'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:11:44)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">For reference, the softfork activates P2SH,
    CSV, and SegWit.</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-16'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:13:06)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">The softfork is expected to activate in a
    little bit over 2 months from now.</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-17'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:13:06)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">Note that because P2SH and SegWit repurpose the
    semantics of scriptPubKeys that were previously considered "anyone
    can spend", there is an incentive for miners to try to get away with
    mischief if a lot of users haven't upgraded their full nodes</span>
    <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-23'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:20:03)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">So, I strongly recommend that anyone running
    Namecoin Core who doesn't need the name management GUI should
    upgrade to 0.18.0 as soon as possible.</span> <span
    class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-24'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:20:42)</span></li>
</ol>
<br></li>
<li><b class="TOPIC">Miscellaneous Golang Project Updates</b> <span class="details">(<a href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-27'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>, 19:23:55)</span>
<ol type="a">
  <li><span class="INFO">I've successfully split out Namecoin's fork of
    `crypto/x509` into its own repo.  This allows ncdns's repo to be
    revised independently of the Golang compiler version.</span> <span
    class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-29'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:25:37)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">This is a critical step towards integrating
    with Tor's build system.  I haven't yet configured ncdns-repro or
    tor-browser-build to use this, but it should be pretty easy.</span>
    <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-30'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:26:40)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">I've also successfully gotten ncdns to work
    with a current release of Conformal's btcd RPC client library,
    instead of the stupid 4-year-old heavily-patched fork that we
    weren't maintaining.</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-31'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:27:46)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">One of the patches we were carrying wasn't
    relevant anymore (only mattered for ancient Core versions); another
    was fixed upstream long ago (ConsensusJ and Electrum support); the
    last one I've submitted upstream for review (cookie authentication
    support)</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-32'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:29:08)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">I did need to submit a patch upstream to
    Conformal that changes 3 API symbols from private to exported, so
    that we can add Namecoin-specific RPC calls.  It's submitted,
    hopefully they'll look at it soon.  If they don't get to it soon, we
    can probably maintain our own fork for a while (it's a trivial
    patch).</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-34'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:30:59)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">Currently the new Namecoin RPC client package
    exposes `NameShow`, `NameScan`, and `NameQuery`, the last one of
    which is like `NameShow` but only returns the value without the
    metadata.</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-35'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:32:06)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">As a side effect of this refactor, `ncdt` and
    `ncdumpzone` now support cookie authentication.</span> <span
    class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-36'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:32:56)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">Meanwhile, I started doing reproducibility
    testing on ncdns.  It turns out that we're not reproducible right
    now.  I traced the bug via Diffoscope, and found that there's a bug
    in upstream rbm.</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-37'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:34:31)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">Specifically, upstream rbm contaminates tar.gz
    files with timestamps as part of the gzip header</span> <span
    class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-38'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:34:58)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">I tried switching to tar.xz and that was
    reproducible, so that's a short-term fix.  I chatted with Nicolas
    from Tor about the issue, and he helped me code up a patch that
    fixes tar.gz; I've submitted that and it's awaiting review.</span>
    <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-39'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:36:04)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">I also addressed Nicolas's feedback on the
    Golang build script refactor patch; it's now awaiting review as
    well.</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-40'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:37:08)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">One more thing: documentation is now written
    for using ncp11 with Tor Browser.  So we're very very close to a
    release of ncp11.</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-41'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    19:40:56)</span></li>
</ol>
<br></li>
<li><b class="TOPIC">Electrum-NMC</b> <span class="details">(<a href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-60'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>, 20:07:18)</span>
<ol type="a">
  <li><span class="INFO">The primary blocker from Tor's perspective at
    this point is stream isolation for name lookups in Electrum-NMC,
    along with the plumbing to get Tor to pass its stream isolation data
    through to Electrum-NMC.</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-62'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    20:10:07)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">I've started discussing with the upstream
    Electrum devs about how they want this to be done.  I'm hoping to
    have a patch submitted upstream within a couple weeks, along with a
    Namecoin-specific patch for the parts that aren't applicable to
    Bitcoin.</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-63'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    20:10:14)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">The initial patch will probably have
    performance issues, because it will do a TCP handshake + TLS
    handshake + Electrum handshake on-demand each time a new stream ID
    is opened.  The "right way" to handle this is to preemptively open
    connections for use by stream-isolated RPC commands, but doing this
    safely without side channel leaks is complicated, and I'm probably
    not going to bother with that until after</span> <span
    class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-64'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    20:12:07)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">Meanwhile, I'm happy to report that I'm no
    longer the only active Electrum-NMC developer.  Xaya is funding
    Daniel to do Electrum-NMC development now; he's already sent in some
    PR's.</span> <span class="details">(<a
    href='namecoin-dev.2019-08-04-19.02.log.html#l-66'>Jeremy_Rand_Talo</a>,
    20:14:52)</span></li>
  <li><span class="INFO">It also looks like there's a chance we can get
    Xaya to sponsor the SegVal scalability work for Namecoin.  Daniel
    informs me that SegVal is similar enough to some stuff that Xaya
    wants, that it's likely that SegVal can share a lot of
    implementation code with Xaya.  No confirmation on this yet
    though.</span> <span class="details">(<a

<ol type="a">
  <li><span class="INFO">You've probably by now seen the media circus
    about OpenNIC following the recommendation from me and PRISM Break
    lead maintainer Yegor Timoshenko to remove .bit from their root
    zone.</span> <span class="details">(<a

  <li><span class="INFO">A journalist from ZDNet.fr (who's interviewed
    me before) asked me for a comment on the subject; I replied with a
    quite extensive/detailed statement including a timeline of relevant
    events and various other analysis.  I'm very glad I did, because his
    article on the subject turned out great IMO.
