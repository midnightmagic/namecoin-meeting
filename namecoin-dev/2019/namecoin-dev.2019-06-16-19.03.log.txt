19:03:39 <TheJollyRoger> Yo-ho!
19:03:53 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Hi everyone, welcome to the meeting!
19:04:02 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Can we get a roll call of who's here today?
19:04:11 <TheJollyRoger> Present and accounted for, cap'n!
19:04:24 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Hi TheJollyRoger
19:07:00 <cannon-c[m]> aye
19:08:00 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> yay, the return of cannon-c ðŸ™‚
19:08:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr-harr!
19:09:53 * Jeremy_Rand_Talo notes that we now have 2 people in this channel whose usernames are pirate references ðŸ™‚
19:10:21 <TheJollyRoger> \o/
19:12:04 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Okay, so.  First topic:
19:12:26 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #topic Namecoin Core
19:13:32 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #info Namecoin Core 0.18.0 has binaries built.  We're just waiting for Gitian sigs to flow in.
19:14:11 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #idea Should I ask on /r/Namecoin for volunters to build Gitian sigs?
19:15:48 * TheJollyRoger unfortunately doesn't know about this sort of stuff :(.
19:16:05 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> (side note: there's a tornado warning that just got issued 2 counties north of here, so I might need to vanish from the meeting on short notice)
19:17:35 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> oh cool, and the tornado is headed in this direction too
19:19:22 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> TheJollyRoger: if I gave you instructions for doing Gitian builds, would you be up for trying it out?  It's not particularly difficult for someone who's competent enough to install Gentoo and who uses GPG
19:20:08 <TheJollyRoger> I would be!
19:20:25 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Oh crap.
19:21:01 <TheJollyRoger> I can't do it on my desktop build, but I can spin you up a Fedora or Debian ppc64 virtual machine.
19:21:27 <TheJollyRoger> (I just haven't gotten the operating system to work in a virtual machine before >_<)
19:21:53 <TheJollyRoger> (Oh crap about the Tornado) -- keep us posted, eh? I hope everything will be alright.
19:22:27 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Specifically: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs/blob/master/gitian-building.md and https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core/blob/nc0.18.0/doc/release-process.md  .  Unfortunately it doesn't work in ppc64le yet, you'd have to use an x86_64 machine
19:24:00 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Ah SHOOT and I gotta get that reproducible build harness and Tor Browser built >_<. Sorry... I'm really behind on that X(
19:25:06 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> TheJollyRoger: if you only have time for 1, building Namecoin Core is somewhat higher priority from our end than building Tor Browser
19:26:17 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
19:27:01 <TheJollyRoger> I remember I got as far as trying to build one of the dependencies and got stuck. I'll go back at it in a bit. I'm hoping to try to get better work hours at my day job, so I'm optimistic I may get more free time in the future.
19:27:43 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #action TheJollyRoger  will (maybe) do a Gitian build of Namecoin Core
19:28:05 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
19:28:11 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Any opinions on whether I should ask on Reddit for volunteers to do Gitian builds for us?
19:29:46 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. More hands and eyes might help, but I don't know what the downsides might be.
19:38:28 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> TheJollyRoger: no particular downsides, besides (1) risk of wasting time helping users who aren't technically skilled enough to make it work easily; (2) if all of the volunteers are compromised by the same adversary, then they could produce reproducibly malicious binaries (though those binaries wouldn't match mine, so it would trigger an investigation rather than posting bad binaries)
19:39:22 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. Hmm. I'm not sure, this is not something I've ever thought about.
19:40:52 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> My inclination is to ask on Reddit; it might have the beneficial side effect of getting more people involved in Namecoin dev generally
19:41:36 <cannon-c[m]> Would also introduce gitian and the process to many. Would be good educational/learning experience for many.
19:43:14 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> cannon-c: yes, definitely.  Tinkering with Gitian is how I got the skill set that I'm now using to port Tor Browser to ARM/POWER.
19:43:19 <cannon-c[m]> for those who have not done such a thing before. And getting more people to be involved with it would create more contingency.
19:44:52 <cannon-c[m]> For disadvantage #2, I think that the more people there are, the more likelyhood that a mismatching sig would be noticed?
19:45:02 <TheJollyRoger> Woah.
19:45:23 <cannon-c[m]> I think that such an attack would be made harder with the more people involved? Since such would be more likely noticed?
19:46:06 <cannon-c[m]> sorry for repeat. Lag on my side.
19:46:58 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> cannon-c: if the samples are representative of the same population, then yes.  However, people responding to a Reddit thread are likely to be somewhat less technically sophisticated than people responding to a comment in this channel, so there's a higher risk of those people being compromised.
19:47:22 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Generally I do think it's a beneficial tradeoff, all things considered
19:48:37 <cannon-c[m]> Good points. but I am sure that most people whom would volunteer would be a mix of people from different regions, and hardware and software. Diversity is good for security in some cases. So maybe posting on reddit would enhance the diversity of such possibly.
19:49:12 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> cannon-c: yes, I agree
19:49:33 <cannon-c[m]> If more people on reddit are less technical. It would be also good opportunity to get them to become more active in technical things. Yes pros/cons for sure.
19:49:35 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. Okay!
19:49:42 <cannon-c[m]> just my opinions/thoughts
19:50:35 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Sounds like we have a general consensus here in favor of asking on Reddit?
19:50:56 <cannon-c[m]> and even if people doing it are more likely to be compromised, then at least attacks would be easier to notice. Think of it like a canary of the existence of an adversary
19:51:48 <cannon-c[m]> even if majority has sigs for bad builds, even the minority of something different would still raise questions, right?
19:53:04 <cannon-c[m]> *even if majority generates sigs for bad builds
19:53:28 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. It'd give a good way to test the reproducibility, that's for sure.
19:53:33 <TheJollyRoger> And our supply lines.
19:53:40 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> cannon-c: I would probably veto publishing binaries that didn't match my hashes prior to an investigation into what happened.
19:54:17 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> I don't know what upstream Bitcoin Core's policies are on this question
19:55:41 <cannon-c[m]> <Jeremy_Rand_Talo "cannon-c: I would probably veto "> good idea
20:00:01 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #action Jeremy_Rand_Talos will ask on Reddit for volunteers to do Gitian builds of Namecoin Core
20:00:55 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Any other Namecoin Core related things to bring up before we move on to the next topic?
20:02:15 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. I don't think so!
20:02:19 <TheJollyRoger> Er, at least not me.
20:04:45 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #topic ncdns etc
20:05:50 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #info A lot of progress has happened with building ncdns (and the rest of the Namecoin Go ecosystem) with rbm
20:09:45 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #info ncdns now builds for GNU/Linux and Windows in master branch of ncdns-repro, and there are PR's adding macOS target, as well as DNSSEC-HSTS, ncp11, and certdehydrate-dane-rest-api projects.  ncp11's rbm binaries are tested and working on Tor Browser for GNU/Linux and Windows, as well as Firefox for Debian Buster.
20:10:56 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #info That means we should shortly be able to claim the "TLS Tor Browser" NLnet milestone
20:12:32 <TheJollyRoger> Wow!
20:18:56 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #info Hopefully soon we'll get ncdns-nsis (ncdns Windows installer) building in rbm as well
20:20:10 * cannon-c[m] has to leave. Plans to read backlog of messages later. Good bye.
20:21:13 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> ok
20:22:43 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
20:23:44 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Anyone have anything  else ncdns-related to cover before we move onto the next topic?
20:26:49 <TheJollyRoger> I don't.
20:29:02 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #topic Electrum-NMC
20:31:11 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #info I've resubmitted my Merkle checkpoint PR to upstream Electrum, including a bunch of abstractions that will be highly useful for adapting it to AuxPoW with minimal patch size.  Hopefully they'll be able to merge it soon.  This will allow Electrum-NMC to do name lookups much more efficiently.
20:35:56 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Any other Electrum-NMC things to cover before we move onto the next topic?
20:36:09 <TheJollyRoger> I don't have any!
20:39:43 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #topic Public Relations
20:40:39 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> #info I need to follow up with Cypher Market about adding Namecoin merchandise.  Will hopefully get to it in the next week.
20:41:38 <TheJollyRoger> Arr \o/
20:45:14 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Random other fun thing: I'll be in the live studio audience for Redacted Tonight sometime next month.  Anything I should say to Lee?  ðŸ™‚
20:46:14 <TheJollyRoger> Woah.
20:46:24 <TheJollyRoger> Woah woah you'll be at a show?
20:46:44 <TheJollyRoger> Woah, Lee Camp?
20:46:51 <TheJollyRoger> From Washington Post?
20:48:45 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> TheJollyRoger: *Redacted Tonight* is the comedy news show on RT America; yes, it's hosted by Lee Camp
20:48:58 <TheJollyRoger> Wowwwww!
20:50:32 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> I was able to rig some travel plans so that I'd be passing through Washington DC anyway, so I decided to go to a Redacted Tonight live taping (it's gratis to get in)
20:51:41 <TheJollyRoger> Oh man. Wow!
20:55:31 <TheJollyRoger> I have to switch devices, so I'll be a bit high latency.
20:56:58 <somewhat[m]> *somewhat likes that quite a few "(not in namecoin)"s will be removed from the release-process.md shortly
20:57:47 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Any other public relations things to cover?
20:57:56 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> hi somewhat
21:02:44 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> TheJollyRoger: any other topics you'd like to cover today?
21:08:13 <TheJollyRoger-M> I don't think so!
21:08:18 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> somewhat: anything you'd like to cover?
21:08:45 <somewhat[m]> no :)
21:10:14 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> Ok.  Anyone else have something to bring up today?
21:13:57 <Jeremy_Rand_Talo> okay then.  Thanks for attending everyone!
