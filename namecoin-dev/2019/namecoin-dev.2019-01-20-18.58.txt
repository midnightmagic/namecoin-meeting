Meeting summary
---------------
* Electrum-NMC  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:05:16)
  * there's a lot of upstream stuff from Electrum that needs to be
    merged into Electrum-NMC  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:05:47)
  * I've started merging it yesterday, and have made some progress, but
    might not actually be caught up before tomorrow  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:06:15)
  * I'm also spending a bit of time trying to get some refactors merged
    upstream by Electrum, so that Namecoin can more easily merge
    upstream changes in the future.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:07:39)
  * Specifically, I'm starting with some refactors to make `UTXOList`
    easier to subclass (we have a subclass called `UNOList` which
    currently needs to duplicate a lot of `UTXOList` code)
    (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:08:39)

* GSoC  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:10:27)
  * Unfortunately, it's pretty clear that I'm already overextended in
    terms of both dev and logistics right now.  As a result, I'm not
    going to be able to handle being a GSoC admin or mentor this year
    without half-assing it, and that wouldn't be ethical to the
    students.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:11:48)
  * So, looks like we won't apply to GSoC this year.  2020 is likely to
    be a lot better.  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo, 19:12:17)
  * On the bright side, it does look like some new developers may be in
    the process of coming on board, via non-GSoC recruiting mechanisms.
    (35C3 was very helpful in this regard.)  (Jeremy_Rand_Talo,
    19:14:10)

Meeting ended at 19:21:51 UTC.
